 10 TeamBuilding Games That Promote Critical Thinking 1    If You Build it… This teambuilding game is flexible    Simply divide students into teams and give them equal amounts of a certain material  like pipe cleaners  blocks  or even dried spaghetti and marshmallows    Then  give them something to construct    The challenge can be variable  think    Which team can build the tallest  structurallysound castle? Which team can build a castle the fastest?     You can recycle this activity throughout the year by adapting the challenge or materials to specific content areas    Skills    Communication    problemsolving 2    Save the Egg This activity can get messy and may be suitable for older children who can follow safety guidelines when working with raw eggs    Teams must work together to find a way to “save” the egg  Humpty Dumpty for elementary school students?  — in this case an egg dropped from a specific height    That could involve finding the perfect soft landing  or creating a device that guides the egg safely to the ground    Let their creativity work here    Skills    Problemsolving  creative collaboration 3    Zoom Zoom is a classic classroom cooperative game that never seems to go out of style    Simply form students into a circle and give each a unique picture of an object  animal or whatever else suits your fancy    You begin a story that incorporates whatever happens to be on your assigned photo    The next student continues the story  incorporating their photo  and so on    Skills    Communication    creative collaboration 4    Minefield Another classic teambuilding game    Arrange some sort of obstacle course and divide students into teams    Students take turns navigating the “mine field” while blindfolded  with only their teammates to guide them    You can also require students to only use certain words or clues to make it challenging or contentarea specific    Skills    Communication    trust  5    The WorstCase Scenario Fabricate a scenario in which students would need to work together and solve problems to succeed  like being stranded on a deserted island or getting lost at sea    Ask them to work together to concoct a solution that ensures everyone arrives safely    You might ask them to come up with a list of 10 musthave items that would help them most  or a creative passage to safety    Encourage them to vote — everyone must agree to the final solution    Skills    Communication  problemsolving 6    A Shrinking Vessel This game requires a good deal of strategy in addition to team work    Its rules are deceptively simple    The entire group must find a way to occupy a space that shrinks over time  until they are packed creatively like sardines    You can form the boundary with a rope  a tarp or blanket being folded over or small traffic cones     Skills    Problemsolving    teamwork  7    Go for Gold This game is similar to the “If you build it” game    Teams have a common objective  but instead of each one having the same materials  they have access to a whole cache of materials    For instance  the goal might be to create a contraption with pipes  rubber tubing and pieces of cardboard that can carry a marble from point A to point B in a certain number of steps  using only gravity    Skills    Creative collaboration    communication    problemsolving 8    It s a Mystery Many children  and grownups  enjoy a good mystery  so why not design one that must be solved cooperatively? Give each student a numbered clue    In order to solve the mystery — say  the case of the missing mascot — children must work together to solve the clues in order    The “case” might require them to move from one area of the room to the next  uncovering more clues    Skills    Problemsolving  communication 9    4Way TugofWar  That playground classic is still a hit — not to mention inexpensive and simple to execute    For a unique variation  set up a multidirectional game by tying ropes in such a way that three or four teams tug at once    Some teams might choose to work together to eliminate the other groups before going headtohead    Skills    Team work    sportsmanship 10    Keep it Real This openended concept is simple and serves as an excellent segue into problembased learning    Challenge students to identify and cooperatively solve a real problem in their schools or communities    You may set the parameters  including a time limit  materials and physical boundaries    Skills    Problemsolving    communication While education technology is a basic and crucial component of the 21st century classroom  educators must still ensure that students are engaging with each other in meaningful ways    Teambuilding exercises are a great way to do this  and because of this  they will never go out of style,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6 Types Of Assessment Of Learning  1    Diagnostic Assessment  as PreAssessment   One way to think about it    Assesses a student s strengths  weaknesses  knowledge  and skills prior to instruction     Another way to think about it    A baseline to work from  2    Formative Assessment  One way to think about it    Assesses a student s performance during instruction  and usually occurs regularly throughout the instruction process     Another way to think about it    Like a doctor s “checkup” to provide data to revise instruction  3    Summative Assessment  One way to think about it    Measures a student s achievement at the end of instruction     Another way to think about it    It s macabre  but if formative assessment is the checkup  you might think of summative assessment as the autopsy    What happened? Now that it s all over  what went right and what went wrong?  4    NormReferenced Assessment  One way to think about it    Compares a student s performance against other students  a national group or other “norm”    Another way to think about it    Group or “Demographic” assessment  5    CriterionReferenced Assessment  One way to think about it    Measures a student s performance against a goal  specific objective  or standard     Another way to think about it    a bar to measure all students against  6    Interim/Benchmark Assessment  One way to think about it    Evaluates student performance at periodic intervals  frequently at the end of a grading period    Can predict student performance on endoftheyear summative assessments     Another way to think about it    Bar graph growth through a year,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20 Ways to Provide Effective Feedback 1    Feedback should be educative in nature     Providing feedback means giving students an explanation of what they are doing correctly AND incorrectly     However  the focus of the feedback should be based essentially on what the students is doing right     It is most productive to a student s learning when they are provided with an explanation and example as to what is accurate and inaccurate about their work    Use the concept of a “feedback sandwich” to guide your feedback    Compliment  Correct  Compliment    2    Feedback should be given in a timely manner     When feedback is given immediately after showing proof of learning  the student responds positively and remembers the experience about what is being learned in a confident manner     If we wait too long to give feedback  the moment is lost and the student might not connect the feedback with the action    3    Be sensitive to the individual needs of the student    It is vital that we take into consideration each student individually when giving feedback     Our classrooms are full of diverse learners     Some students need to be nudged to achieve at a higher level and other needs to be handled very gently so as not to discourage learning and damage selfesteem    A balance between not wanting to hurt a student s feelings and providing proper encouragement is essential    4    Ask the 4 questions    Studies of effective teaching and learning  Dinham  2002  2007a    2007b  have shown that learners want to know where they stand in regards to their work     Providing answers to the following four questions on a regular basis will help provide quality feedback     These four questions are also helpful when providing feedback to parents    ? What can the student do? ? What can t the student do? ? How does the student s work compare with that of others? ? How can the student do better? 5    Feedback should reference a skill or specific knowledge     This is when rubrics become a useful tool     A rubric is an instrument to communicate expectations for an assignment     Effective rubrics provide students with very specific information about their performance  comparative to an established range of standards    For younger students  try highlighting rubric items that the student is meeting or try using a sticker chart    6    Give feedback to keep students “on target” for achievement    Regular ‘checkins  with students lets them know where they stand in the classroom and with you     Utilize the ‘4 questions  to guide your feedback    7    Host a oneonone conference    Providing a oneonone meeting with a student is one of the most effective means of providing feedback     The student will look forward to having the attention and allows the opportunity to ask necessary questions     A oneonone conference should be generally optimistic  as this will encourage the student to look forward to the next meeting    As with all aspects of teaching  this strategy requires good time management     Try meeting with a student while the other students are working independently     Time the meetings so that they last no longer than 10 minutes    8    Feedback can be given verbally  nonverbally or in written form     Be sure to keep your frowns in check    It is imperative that we examine our nonverbal cues    Facial expressions and gestures are also means of delivering feedback     This means that when you hand back that English paper  it is best not to scowl    9    Concentrate on one ability     It makes a far greater impact on the student when only one skill is critiqued versus the entire paper being the focus of everything that is wrong     For example  when I taught Writer s Workshop at the elementary level  I would let students know that for that day I was going to be checking on the indentation of paragraphs within their writing     When I conferenced with a student  that was my focus instead of all the other aspects of their writing     The next day would feature a new focus    10    Alternate due dates for your students/classes     Utilize this strategy when grading papers or tests    This strategy allows you the necessary time to provide quality  written feedback     This can also include using a rotation chart for students to conference with at a deeper more meaningful level     Students will also know when it is their turn to meet with you and are more likely to bring questions of their own to the conference    11    Educate students on how to give feedback to each other     Model for students what appropriate feedback looks like and sounds like     As an elementary teacher  we call this ‘peer conferencing      Train students to give each other constructive feedback in a way that is positive and helpful     Encourage students to use postit notes to record the given feedback    12    Ask another adult to give feedback     The principal at the school I taught at would often volunteer to grade history tests or read student s writing pieces     You can imagine how the student s quality of work increased tenfold!  If the principal is too busy  and most are   invite a ‘guest  teacher or student teacher to critique work    13    Have the student take notes     During a conference over a test  paper or a general ‘check in   have the student do the writing while you do the talking    The student can use a notebook to jot down notes as you provide the verbal feedback    14    Use a notebook to keep track of student progress    Keep a section of a notebook for each student     Write daily or weekly  dated comments about each student as necessary     Keep track of good questions the student asks  behavior issues  areas for improvement  test scores etc     Of course this requires a lot of essential time management but when it is time to conference with a student or parent  you are ready to go    15    Return tests  papers or comment cards at the beginning of class      Returning papers and tests at the beginning of class  rather than at the end  allows students to ask necessary questions and to hold a relevant discussion    16    Use PostIt notes    Sometimes seeing a comment written out is more effective than just hearing it aloud    During independent work time  try writing feedback comments on a postit note    Place the note on the student s desk the feedback is meant for     One of my former students had a difficult time staying on task but he would get frustrated and embarrassed when I called him out on his inattentive behaviors in front of the class    He would then shut down and refused to do any work because he was mad that I humiliated him     I resorted to using postit notes to point out when he was on task or not     Although it was not the most effective use of my time  it really worked for him    17    Give genuine praise     Students are quick to figure out which teachers use meaningless praise to win approval    If you are constantly telling your students “Good Job” or “Nice Work” then  over time  these words become meaningless     Make a big deal out of a student s A+ on that vocabulary test     If you are thrilled with a student s recent ontask behaviors  go above and beyond with the encouragement and praise    Make a phone call home to let mom or dad know how thrilled you are with the student s behavior    Comments and suggestions within genuine feedback should also be ‘focused  practical and based on an assessment of what the student can do and is capable of achieving   Dinham     18     “I noticed…   ” Make an effort to notice a student s behavior or effort at a task     For example    “I noticed when you regrouped correctly in the hundreds column  you got the problem right   ” “I noticed you arrived on time to class this entire week   ”  Acknowledging a student and the efforts they are making goes a long way to positively influence academic performance    19    Provide a model or example    Communicate with your students the purpose for an assessment and/or feedback     Demonstrate to students what you are looking for by giving them an example of what an A+ paper looks like     Provide a contrast of what a C paper looks like     This is especially important at the upper learning levels    20    Invite students to give YOU feedback    Remember when you finished a class in college and you were given the chance to ‘grade  the professor?  How nice was it to finally tell the professor that the reading material was so incredibly boring without worrying about it affecting your grade? Why not let students give you feedback on how you are doing as a teacher? Make it so that they can do it anonymously    What did they like about your class? What didn t they like? If they were teaching the class  what would they do differently? What did they learn the most from you as a teacher? If we are open to it  we will quickly learn a few things about ourselves as educators    Remember that feedback goes both ways and as teachers it is wise to never stop improving and honing our skills as teachers,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1    Give students a sense of control    While guidance from a teacher is important to keeping kids on task and motivated  allowing students to have some choice and control over what happens in the classroom is actually one of the best ways to keep them engaged    For example  allowing students to choose the type of assignment they do or which problems to work on can give them a sense of control that may just motivate them to do more    2    Define the objectives    It can be very frustrating for students to complete an assignment or even to behave in class if there aren t clearly defined objectives    Students want and need to know what is expected of them in order to stay motivated to work    At the beginning of the year  lay out clear objectives  rules  and expectations of students so that there is no confusion and students have goals to work towards    3    Create a threatfree environment    While students do need to understand that there are consequences to their actions  far more motivating for students than threats are positive reinforcements    When teachers create a safe  supportive environment for students  affirming their belief in a student s abilities rather than laying out the consequences of not doing things  students are much more likely to get and stay motivated to do their work    At the end of the day  students will fulfill the expectations that the adults around them communicate  so focus on can  not can t    4    Change your scenery    A classroom is a great place for learning  but sitting at a desk day in and day out can make school start to seem a bit dull for some students    To renew interest in the subject matter or just in learning in general  give your students a chance to get out of the classroom    Take field trips  bring in speakers  or even just head to the library for some research    The brain loves novelty and a new setting can be just what some students need to stay motivated to learn    5    Offer varied experiences    Not all students will respond to lessons in the same way    For some  handson experiences may be the best    Others may love to read books quietly or to work in groups    In order to keep all students motivated  mix up your lessons so that students with different preferences will each get time focused on the things they like best    Doing so will help students stay engaged and pay attention    6    Use positive competition    Competition in the classroom isn t always a bad thing  and in some cases can motivate students to try harder and work to excel    Work to foster a friendly spirit of competition in your classroom  perhaps through group games related to the material or other opportunities for students to show off their knowledge    7    Offer rewards    Everyone likes getting rewards  and offering your students the chance to earn them is an excellent source of motivation    Things like pizza parties  watching movies  or even something as simple as a sticker on a paper can make students work harder and really aim to achieve    Consider the personalities and needs of your students to determine appropriate rewards for your class    8    Give students responsibility    Assigning students classroom jobs is a great way to build a community and to give students a sense of motivation    Most students will see classroom jobs as a privilege rather than a burden and will work hard to ensure that they  and other students  are meeting expectations    It can also be useful to allow students to take turns leading activities or helping out so that each feels important and valued    9    Allow students to work together    While not all students will jump at the chance to work in groups  many will find it fun to try to solve problems  do experiments  and work on projects with other students    The social interaction can get them excited about things in the classroom and students can motivate one another to reach a goal    Teachers need to ensure that groups are balanced and fair  however  so that some students aren t doing more work than others    10    Give praise when earned    There is no other form of motivation that works quite as well as encouragement    Even as adults we crave recognition and praise  and students at any age are no exception    Teachers can give students a bounty of motivation by rewarding success publicly  giving praise for a job well done  and sharing exemplary work    11    Encourage selfreflection    Most kids want to succeed  they just need help figuring out what they need to do in order to get there    One way to motivate your students is to get them to take a hard look at themselves and determine their own strengths and weaknesses    Students are often much more motivated by creating these kinds of critiques of themselves than by having a teacher do it for them  as it makes them feel in charge of creating their own objectives and goals    12    Be excited    One of the best ways to get your students motivated is to share your enthusiasm    When you re excited about teaching  they ll be much more excited about learning    It s that simple    13    Know your students    Getting to know your students is about more than just memorizing their names    Students need to know that their teacher has a genuine interest in them and cares about them and their success    When students feel appreciated it creates a safe learning environment and motivates them to work harder  as they want to get praise and good feedback from someone they feel knows and respects them as individuals    14    Harness student interests    Knowing your students also has some other benefits  namely that it allows you to relate classroom material to things that students are interested in or have experienced    Teachers can use these interests to make things more interesting and relatable to students  keeping students motivated for longer    15    Help students find intrinsic motivation    It can be great to help students get motivated  but at the end of the day they need to be able to generate their own motivation    Helping students find their own personal reasons for doing class work and working hard  whether because they find material interesting  want to go to college  or just love to learn  is one of the most powerful gifts you can give them    16    Manage student anxiety    Some students find the prospect of not doing well so anxietyinducing that it becomes a selffulfilling prophecy    For these students  teachers may find that they are most motivated by learning that struggling with a subject isn t the end of the world    Offer support no matter what the end result is and ensure that students don t feel so overwhelmed by expectations that they just give up    17    Make goals high but attainable    If you re not pushing your students to do more than the bare minimum  most won t seek to push themselves on their own    Students like to be challenged and will work to achieve high expectations so long as they believe those goals to be within their reach  so don t be afraid to push students to get more out of them    18    Give feedback and offer chances to improve    Students who struggle with class work can sometimes feel frustrated and get down on themselves  draining motivation    In these situations it s critical that teachers help students to learn exactly where they went wrong and how they can improve next time    Figuring out a method to get where students want to be can also help them to stay motivated to work hard    19    Track progress    It can be hard for students to see just how far they ve come  especially with subjects that are difficult for them    Tracking can come in handy in the classroom  not only for teachers but also for students    Teachers can use this as a way to motivate students  allowing them to see visually just how much they are learning and improving as the year goes on    20    Make things fun    Not all class work needs to be a game or a good time  but students who see school as a place where they can have fun will be more motivated to pay attention and do the work that s required of them than those who regard it as a chore    Adding fun activities into your school day can help students who struggle to stay engaged and make the classroom a much more friendly place for all students    21    Provide opportunities for success    Students  even the best ones  can become frustrated and demotivated when they feel like they re struggling or not getting the recognition that other students are    Make sure that all students get a chance to play to their strengths and feel included and valued    It can make a world of difference in their motivation,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1    Visualization Bring dull academic concepts to life with visual and practical learning experiences  helping your students to understand how their schooling applies in the realworld     Examples include using the interactive whiteboard to display photos  audio clips and videos  as well as encouraging your students to get out of their seats with classroom experiments and local field trips        2    Cooperative learning   Encourage students of mixed abilities to work together by promoting small group or whole class activities     Through verbally expressing their ideas and responding to others your students will develop their selfconfidence  as well as enhance their communication and critical thinking skills which are vital throughout life     Solving mathematical puzzles  conducting scientific experiments and acting out short drama sketches are just a few examples of how cooperative learning can be incorporated into classroom lessons     3    Inquirybased instruction Pose thoughtprovoking questions which inspire your students to think for themselves and become more independent learners     Encouraging students to ask questions and investigate their own ideas helps improve their problemsolving skills as well as gain a deeper understanding of academic concepts    Both of which are important life skills     Inquiries can be science or mathbased such as ‘why does my shadow change size?  or ‘is the sum of two odd numbers always an even number?     However  they can also be subjective and encourage students to express their unique views  e   g    ‘do poems have to rhyme?  or ‘should all students wear uniform?      4    Differentiation Differentiate your teaching by allocating tasks based on students  abilities  to ensure no one gets left behind     Assigning classroom activities according to students  unique learning needs means individuals with higher academic capabilities are stretched and those who are struggling get the appropriate support     This can involve handing out worksheets that vary in complexity to different groups of students  or setting up a range of work stations around the classroom which contain an assortment of tasks for students to choose from     Moreover  using an educational tool such as Quizalize can save you hours of time because it automatically groups your students for you  so you can easily identify individual and whole class learning gaps  click here to find out more      5    Technology in the classroom Incorporating technology into your teaching is a great way to actively engage your students  especially as digital media surrounds young people in the 21st century     Interactive whiteboards or mobile devices can be used to display images and videos  which helps students visualize new academic concepts    Learning can become more interactive when technology is used as students can physically engage during lessons as well as instantly research their ideas  which develops autonomy     Mobile devices  such as iPads and/or tablets  can be used in the classroom for students to record results  take photos/videos  or simply as a behaviour management technique    Plus  incorporating educational programmes such as Quizalize into your lesson plans is also a great way to make formative assessments fun and engaging     6    Behaviour management Implementing an effective behaviour management strategy is crucial to gain your students respect and ensure students have an equal chance of reaching their full potential     Noisy  disruptive classrooms do no encourage a productive learning environment  therefore developing an atmosphere of mutual respect through a combination of discipline and reward can be beneficial for both you and your students     Examples include fun and interactive reward charts for younger students  where individuals move up or down based on behaviour with the top student receiving a prize at the end of the week    ‘Golden time  can also work for students of all ages  with a choice of various activities such as games or no homework in reward for their hard work     7    Professional development Engaging in regular professional development programmes is a great way to enhance teaching and learning in your classroom     With educational policies constantly changing it is extremely useful to attend events where you can gain inspiration from other teachers and academics    It s also a great excuse to get out of the classroom and work alongside other teachers just like you!,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Growing as a teacher is all about challenging yourself–moving out of our comfort zone  trying something new    Here are 50 ideas to consider     Learn a second language fluently  preferably one that is increasingly spoken in your geographical area     Create a closed social media community for your classroom–then use it    Challenge the district internet filter and win    Make sure every unit has a meaningful product of some kind that leaves the classroom    Read a balance of “Why teach?” with “How to teach” content    Describe the approach to learning taken in your classroom in one sentence  then ask for feedback via your professional learning network on social media    Make sure parents understand that sentence  too    Resist corny email signatures that don t inspire anyone    Give equal credit for questions and answers     Literally give ‘points  or whatever it is you use     Know the difference between differentiation and personalization    Get rid of your teacher s desk completely    Certify yourself in a second content area or grade level    Present at a local conference with a colleague    Present at state or national conference    Create a syllabus that s actually useful to parents and students    Ensure that every single assignment is accessible to every single student in terms of reading level  background knowledge  and technology access    Write a research paper of at least 1000 words on the history of public education     You may be surprised what you learn     Read a book on education that seems to reflect the opposite of what you believe    Reach out to every single parent/family of students and create an authentic reason for them to visit your classroom this year    Connect every student with a mentor in the community    Flip your classroom    Laugh with your students  even if you have to play standup comedy    Shred all scripted curriculum    Have students record and curate the audio from every single group assignment    Smile at every student  every day    Or greet them at the door with a cool handshake    Throw out letter grades    Assign optional homework every night    encourage those that need the practice to do it and those that don t to create their own    Stay at home when you re sick    Use sentence stems that reflect critical thinking so your students will  too    Make sure students talk more to one another than they do to you during discussions    Throw out all of your lessons and units and start over from scratch    Read to your students  e   g     from a picture book or poem  at least 10 minutes per week no matter your grade level or content area    Use choice boards for every assignment     All of them     Cocreate all rubrics with students    Make it cool to read in your classroom    Admit when you re wrong    End every class with “So?

Critical thinking is the heart and soul of learning  and–in our estimation anyway–ultimately more important than any one specific content area or subject matter     It s also an overused and rather nebulous phrase — how do you teach someone to think? Of course that s the purpose of education  but how do you effectively optimize that concept into lasting knowledge and the ability to apply it broadly?  Looking for more resources to teach critical thinking? Check out our critical thinking curricula resources on TpT     What Is Critical Thinking?  This question is what inspires the creation of seemingly endless learning taxonomies and teaching methods    our desire to pin down a clear definition of what it means to think critically and how to introduce that skill in the classroom     This makes critical thinking questions–well  critical    As Terry Heick explains in What Does Critical Thinking Mean?     “To think critically about something is to claim to first circle its meaning entirely—to walk all the way around it so that you understand it in a way that s uniquely you    The thinker works with their own thinking tools–schema    Background knowledge    Sense of identity    Meaning Making is a process as unique to that thinker as their own thumb print    There is no template     After circling the meaning of whatever you re thinking critically about—a navigation necessarily done with bravado and purpose—the thinker can then analyze the thing    In thinking critically  the thinker has to see its parts  its form  its function  and its context     After this kind of survey and analysis you can come to evaluate it–bring to bear your own distinctive cognition on the thing so that you can point out flaws  underscore bias  emphasize merit—to get inside the mind of the author  designer  creator  or clockmaker and critique his work   ”  A Cheat Sheet For Critical Thinking  In short  critical thinking is more than understanding something — it involves evaluation  critiquing  and a depth of knowledge that surpasses the subject itself and expands outward    It requires problemsolving  creativity  rationalization  and a refusal to accept things at face value     It s a willingness and ability to question everything     The Ultimate Cheat Sheet For Digital Thinking by Global Digital Citizen Foundation is an excellent starting point for the “how” behind teaching critical thinking by outlining which questions to ask     It offers 48 critical thinking questions useful for any content area or even grade level with a little reworking/rewording,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1    TeachThought Learning Taxonomy  The TeachThought Learning Taxonomy is a template for critical thinking that frames cognition across six categories    It imagines any learning product  goal  or objective as a ‘thing    i   e   g  a subject of some kind  then suggests different ways to think about said ‘thing –mitosis  a math formula  an historical figure  a poem  a poet  a computer coding language  a political concept  a literary device  etc    It s designed to promote ‘whole  thinking about otherwise discrete or disconnected ideas    1    Function–thinking critically about how a ‘thing  works 2    Self–Making sense of how the thinker relates to the ‘thing  3    Abstraction–Thinking about the ‘thing  creatively  or in nontraditional ways 4    Parts–Seeing the individual parts of the ‘thing  5    Interdependence–Examining how the ‘thing  relates to other  similar and nonsimilar  things 6    Whole–See the ‘thing  fully and within context A literary device–a metaphor example  is usually studied in isolation    This writer uses this metaphor in this way to this effect    Using the TeachThought Learning Taxonomy  a learner would be forced to confront that metaphor in much more diverse cognitive terrain–to think about something in multiple ways for a more complete picture and advanced understanding    Function–Communicate the metaphor s most ideal utility  how it can and should be used  and why     SelfIdentity what you do and don t understand about the metaphor Abstraction–Design a “sequel” of the metaphor  not a simile–an extended metaphor would be a good start  This framework can be used not only as a planning or assessment tool  but to promote students in selfdirected learning and selfcreated questioning and examination    In short  they can use this framework  or a simplified version of it  to create their own questions    Some examples? Prompt    Parts–Give examples and nonexamples Questions    What are 3 examples and nonexamples of mammals? What are 5 examples of pushpull factors? What are 3 nonexamples of mixed fractions? Prompt    Interdependence–Direct others in using it Questions    How do–or might–others use alternative fuel sources to help create fresh water sources? Prompt    Explain it differently to a novice or an expert Questions    How would explain the Pythagorean Theorem differently to a 2nd grader and a college freshman? What would the main difference be? The downside to using the TeachThought Learning Taxonomy to help students ask their own questions is the relative complexity of the framework  and the extra step of converting prompts to questions    Therefore  it s better suited to late middle school–university settings    The upside? It can be used in any content area to think deeply about almost anything    2    Digital Taxonomy Power Verbs ‘Power verbs  aren t exclusive to Bloom s Taxonomy  see below     In addition to our TeachThought Learning Taxonomy  see above   there are ‘verbs  that describe cognitive ‘actions     Add some kind of framework or hierarchy  and you ve got a full ‘taxonomy     Enter the ‘digital taxonomy  power verbs    You can download a readyfortheclassroom curricula version of our power verbs here  but you can do plenty with digital taxonomy power verbs to help students ask great questions without spending a penny    From designing projects and refining assessments to classroom  discussions and digital citizenship lessons  the ‘actions of students are among the most critical components of any learning experience    3    Socratic Discussion A Socratic Discussion  which is also referred to as a Socratic Seminar  is a group learning strategy designed to support students in openended examination and extended critical thinking through dialogic terms    In short  students learn together by talking together in an open and studentcentered format    These discussions are not teacherled  but studentled–students talk to one another    It is a dialectal method of learning inspired by Socrates  iconic teaching methods that depend on a pattern of theory formation  revision  and elimination to arrive at looselyheld “truths   ” Used strategically  this approach should promote inquiry as learning  and the close examination of one s own beliefs as primary catalysts for learning    4    Paideia Seminar A Paideia Seminar is similar to the Socratic Seminar–in fact  it uses Socratic Discussions on the part of the students  combined with a minor but clear role for teachers  to facilitate verbal and critical examination of ideas    From the  a?  Paideia Seminar website  “The Paideia Seminar is an integrated literacy event built around formal whole class dialogue    The purpose for doing Paideia Seminar is to support students  ability to think conceptually and communicate collaboratively   ” One of the key differences between a Paideia Seminar and a Socratic Seminar is that within the Paideia format  teachers are “allowed” a role  provided that that role doesn t exceed 10% of the total discussion    5    The Question Game  The Question Game focuses on “teaching children a kind of thinking which is particularly useful in creative problemsolving–a focused approach to get from a problem to the most effective solution    It is most effective when combined with regular repetition  which solidifies the thought pattern  and with groups  which encourages contributory exploration of alternative responses and creativity   ” Its diceform not only offers a whizbang manipulative  but also introduces a level of gamification and playful uncertainty into the process  and its openended and universal stems make it practical for a wide variety of classroom applications    6    Bloom s Taxonomy  Similar to the TeachThought Taxonomy  Bloom s Taxonomy can act as a framework or pattern to funnel content  inquiry  or other learning processes    These use of the taxonomy to create universal stems is one approach as modeled in the following graphic from flickr user enokson     7    Question Formulation Technique We ll have more on this soon but in short  the Question Formulation Technique  QFT  is a kind of question brainstorming process based around a topic as a kind of kernel    In their words of the Right Question Institute  QFT is “straightforward  rigorous process that helps all students learn how to produce their own questions  improve their questions  and strategize on how to use their questions    In the process  they develop divergent  convergent and metacognitive thinking abilities   ”  For now  you can read more about the QFT here    8    Universal Question Stems  As seen in the Bloom s graphic  sentence stems and question stems are wonderful tools that can empower students to ask questions by giving them a headstart in doing so    By using a “stem ” a teacher has set the ball on the proverbial tee for the student to smash    Yes  ideally the student asks their own great questions  but what if they can t–or don t think they can? What if they don t? What if they re still learning how? What if they lack the background knowledge in some narrow sect of science or math or whatever  and need a push in the back? Stems can help     See also 26 Sentence Stems For HigherLevel Conversation In The Classroom     Question stems are a more elementary questioning strategy than the Question Formation Technique  see above   but not necessarily less effective    They can be used for younger students  students struggling with a concept  or even “advanced learners”  not a huge fan of this term  as they narrow an openended learning experience  or to be used as “bread crumbs” in the case that the teacher is trying to help them arrive at a predetermined destination    Some examples? 8 Basic Question Stem Examples Which differences between ____ and ____ stand out to you?

6 Critical Thinking Questions For Any Situation 1    What s happening? Establish the basics and begin forming questions    2    Why is it important? Ask yourself why this is or isn t significant    3    What don t I see? Consider  alone or with others  if there s any crucial information or perspective you might be missing  or that the ‘thing  in question is missing    4    How do I know? Identify how you know what you think you know  and how that meaning was constructed    5    Who is saying it?

Analogy Definition An analogy is simply a comparison between two things    In this way  it is similar to the simile and metaphor    We use analogies all the time informally    In conversation  when you compare one situation to another  you re using an analogy    ‘Life is like a box of chocolates  is a simile that also compares analogous ideas–the uncertainty and variety in life experiences with the same in a box of chocolates    Beyond the conversational analogy  there are formal academic analogies    Academic analogies are useful for teaching and learning because they require students to analyze a thing  or things   and then transfer that analysis that analysis to another thing    This kind of transfer requires at least some kind of conceptual grasp–understanding    This makes them useful for assessment  but they can also be used as an effective learning strategy as well    As students create incorrect analogies  analyze the relationships their analogies are suggesting  and then correct them accordingly  students are grappling with ideas  monitoring and revising their thinking  and otherwise actively consider the often complex relationships between disparate things    Imagine asking a student to complete the following analogy    Laws   Constitution      ______   _______ Starting with an open right side  where items C & D are open is not a bad way to start  as it allows students to make mistakes    Which is good–their mistakes are illuminating    They tell you what the student thinks  but do so in a way that doesn t require the writing process  verbal articulation  or some indepth and longterm project that taxes their ability to manage their time and be organized as much as it does their understanding of ideas    So in the journal  for example  a student writes  Laws   Constitution      Weapon   Video Game    This was useful for the student as a learning strategy  as the student had to “think” about what laws “do”  and do so while really  truly internalizing it all    The above “weapon   video game” response tells you the student think that laws function like weapons–destroying enemies  defending the protagonist  doing damage  etc    You may not  at a glance  be sure which–you can ask if you have time–but you can tell here that the student s on the right track    So maybe you suggest a mild revision–Laws   Constitution    Code    Video Game    You may not be sure yourself if this is true–maybe you re only vaguely familiar with how video games work–but you suggest it anyway    Next  you ask the student to critique your answer–say how it is and isn t true    There is zero chance you won t have that student carefully scrutinizing–with whatever knowledge they do have–to come up with something    Who doesn t want to point out a teacher s error? And isn t careful scrutiny what we re after as teachers? Personalizing Learning In maybe their best trick  analogies make differentiation and personalization dead simple    Struggling reader? Use monosyllabic terms    Nonreader? Well  that s a huge problem  but try symbols    Hesitant learner? Use pop culture items that make it seem less like “school   ” Abstract thinker? Use equally abstract and theoretical terms    Wellread? Use literary ideas  figures  etc    Techaddict? Social butterfly? Introvert? Use that! Analogy Function Analogies function by providing a framework for comparison across four concepts    Two items are compared to determine a relationship  and that relationship is then reproduced between two other ideas    Analogy Format In a formal academic analogy  four Items are separated by a series of colons  as in the formula shown below    A   B      C   D The two items on the left  items A & B  describe a relationship  and are separated by a single colon    The two items on the right  items C & D  are shown on the right  and are also separated by a colon    Together  both sides are then separated by two colons in the middle  as demonstrated here    Hot    Cold       Wet    Dry To complete these  students have to identify  analyze  evaluate  and transfer    Consider the following analogy    Fish   River      Bird   _____ Even in this very simple analogy  students might identify a halfdozen characteristics of the relationship between fish and river  their mind scrambling to find relationships    They then analyze that relationship and come up with those most obvious    Fish live in a river  are sometimes found in a river  are caught in a river  love the river  are smaller than a river  etc    With this list  they then have to scrutinize more carefully  evaluating each item accordingly until they can name the relationship in the second part of the analogy that best describes that established in the first    That last part requires some patience–students love to shout out answers  identify and analyze   but the evaluate part takes more effort  so they try to skip it    Don t let them!  See below     Tips For Teaching With Analogies 1    The more consistently you use analogies  the more comfortable students will become with their simple but highly “academic” format    Let s face it–analogies look intimidating and dry    Once they get past that initial impression  they ll be more useful as a teaching and learning tool    2    Background knowledge  social and cultural contexts  socioeconomic status and more all are “part” of a student s experience–and thus their thinking    In the “Fish   River” analogy  students unfamiliar with rivers–those that have always seen fish caught in the ocean  for example–may be confused by this    The same is true using any concept that is less than universal–snow  traffic lights  skyscrapers  apps  etc    3    Subjectivity always plays a role    Even ideas that every student understands can be problematic if they see the relationship differently than you do    Is baseball “America s past time” or “boring”? Was Malcolm X heroic or defiant–or heroic because he was defiant? That doesn t mean you can t use these items  but be prepared to adjust on the fly if students are having trouble    As with any assessment  don t let the form obscure students showing you what they do and don t understand    Rules for Completing Analogy Students love to play fillintheblank with analogies    Nature hates a void  and even confusing analogies can usually get a mildlyengaged student guessing    When going over analogies wholeclass  don t let the students shout out answers  or guess    Make them first complete a sentence that best describes the relation between items A & B  and don t let them go any further until they do    In the following analogy  Soap    Germs      ______   Conflict  require students to first come up with a sentence for items A & B–and not just any true sentence  but once that best describes the relationship between the items    Soap kills germs  or at least washes them away–depends on how carefully students are thinking!  works    So soap kills germs as tolerance kills conflict    That one was easy enough    But when you consider Emily Dickinson   EmDash   Carpenter   ______  the answer is less obvious    Dickinson made extensive use of the EmDash as a carpenter makes extensive use of a hammer–or saw  or whatever    But blueprints  or concrete wouldn t work so well  as carpenters don t  usually  make extensive use of each     14 Types Of Analogies To Promote Thinking Synonym Beginner   Novice      Tone   ________ Antonym Hot   Cold      Free   ______ Part/Whole Stars   Galaxy      Molecules   Object Cause/Effect Rise of Social Messaging   Demise of Email      __________   French Revolution Thing/Function Martin Luther King Jr    s “I Have A Dream”   Civil Rights      ________   Gay Rights Thing/Characteristic Emily Dickson s Poetry   Pious      Robert Frost s Poetry   _________ Thing/Context Field    Farm       Audience Example/Type Of Verbal Irony   _______      Nexus 5   Smartphone Category/Subcategory Shape   Quadrilateral      _______   Oval Object/Classification Porsche 911    Sports Car       Alligator    Reptile Degree of Difference Cool   Cold      Industrialism      ________ Fact/Opinion “It s 93 degrees”   ”It s Hot”      ________   ”Freedom isn t free” Step/Process Revision   Writing Process      ______Sentence Diagramming Problem/Solution Racism   Affection      ________   Time Travel Symbol/Referent  Swastika   Nazi Germany      Faulkner s use of setting in “A Rose for Emily”   ________,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
What does ‘critical thinking  mean? Well  that depends on who you ask    For educators  as a term critical thinking is similar to words like democracy  global  and organic    You hear people use them all the time  but no one seems to understand exactly what they mean    This kind of etymological opacity lends itself to them being misused  fumbled awkwardly  and abused    Over the long term  such abuse empties it of meaning until we all either throw it around casually in the middle of an overly complex sentence to bolster our own credibility  or avoid the term altogether    If we can  for the purpose of the here and now  agree that critical thinking means something along the lines of thinking to produce judgment  then we re already two thirds of the way to making some kind of new meaning ourselves here    Critical thinking is among the first causes for change  personal and social   but is a pariah in schools –for no other reason than it conditions the mind to suspect the form and function of everything it sees  including your classroom and everything being taught in it    Of course  critical thinking without knowledge is embarrassingly idle  like a farmer without a field    They need each other—thought and knowledge    They can also disappear into one another as they work    Once we ve established that—that they re separate  capable of merging  and need one another—we can get at the marrow and fear of this whole thing    More than definition and clarification  we need contextualization–to look around the term as we use it and see when and how it s used  and what kind of reaction it elicits when that happens    Here  there s a lot to look at    how to teach it  how to assess it  what role it plays in the learning process  how to use it in misleading school mission statements  how to casually drop it in classroom walkthroughs or walkthrough documents  in a way that implies I m not exactly sure how this lesson should be made better  so I ll instead encourage you to ‘encourage the kids to think critically   or  There is so much abstraction in your class that I have no idea what s happening but boy there s probably a lot of critical thinking going on     Criticalthinking   org says that critical thinking is    “Critical thinking is that mode of thinking — about any subject  content  or problem — in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing  assessing  and reconstructing it    Critical thinking is selfdirected  selfdisciplined  selfmonitored  and selfcorrective thinking    It presupposes assent to rigorous standards of excellence and mindful command of their use    It entails effective communication and problemsolving abilities  as well as a commitment to overcome our native egocentrism and sociocentrism   ” A paper published in 2004 by a professor at Harvard says that definitions for critical thinking are “available in various sources are quite disparate and are often narrowly field dependent ” offering a psychologybased definition as “Critical thinking examines assumptions  discerns hidden values  evaluates evidence  and assesses conclusions   ” In the same paper  Philosopher Richard Paul and educational psychologists Linda Elder define critical thinking as “That mode of thinking – about any subject  content  or problem – in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully taking charge of the structures inherent in thinking and imposing intellectual standards upon them   ” In education  critical pedagogy and critical thinking overlap almost entirely    The definitions above  while focus on the thinking  don t focus much on the criticism    In critical thinking  the thinking is only a strategy to arrive at informed criticism  which is itself is a starting pointing for understanding one s self and/or the world around you    While in function it can run parallel to the scientific method  science intends to arrive an an unbiased  neutral  and zerohuman conclusion    In critical thinking  there is no conclusion    it is constant interaction with changing circumstances and new knowledge that allows for broader vision which allows for new evidence which starts the process over again    Critical thinking has at its core raw emotion and tone    Intent     To think critically about something is to claim to first circle its meaning entirely—to walk all the way around it so that you understand it in a way that s uniquely you    The thinker works with their own thinking tools–schema    Background knowledge    Sense of identity    Meaning Making is a process as unique to that thinker as their own thumb print    There is no template    After circling the meaning of whatever you re thinking critically about—a navigation necessarily done with bravado and purpose—the thinker can then analyze the thing    In thinking critically  the thinker has to see its parts  its form  its function  and its context    After this kind of survey and analysis you can come to evaluate it–bring to bear your own distinctive cognition on the thing so that you can point out flaws  underscore bias  emphasize merit—to get inside the mind of the author  designer  creator  or clockmaker and critique his work     This clockmaker that has made this clock    This poet that has conjured this poem    This scientist that has worked for months on this study to prove or disprove this ambitious theory    This historian that has contextualized this historical movement in a series of documents and artifacts that now deserve contextualization of their own    To think critically requires you to aggregate knowledge  form some kind of understanding  get inside the mind of the clockmaker  judge their work  and then articulate it all for a specific form  e   g     argumentative essay  and audience  e   g     teacher     Think about what that means    It s easy for teachers to see the role of critical thinking in a more macro process    By analyzing and critiquing the work of others—especially experts—students have to temporarily merge minds with them  or else they re just producing conjecture that sounds smart     By thinking critically  they learn here by imitation—for a moment  running alongside others who  among other functions  act as pacesetters    By combining this kind of angled thought with master workers and their works  we force students to dance with giants—or the holograms of giants    The tone here is intimidating for developing thinkers—or should be anyway    It s a tone that is simultaneously intellectual  collaborative  and defiant    It says  “I ve come to understand this complex thing worthy of study—which probably represents a more significant achievement than anything I ve ever produced in my life—and then bring judgment upon it    I am both capable of all of this  and willing to do it in a way that itself will be judged   ” This is the kind of courage that takes years to grow,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Imagine the dogged pursuit of a proper clockmaker  day after day bound up in design and measurement and function and orderly thinking  forcing exactitude on little bits of metal that never asked for it    And then finally getting it right–so many decisions and matters of design suddenly set the clock off ticking forever    Get inside the mind of a clockmaker—one who still experiments with matters of design  improving their craft with minor revisions of planning and execution—and suddenly you re seeing from ground zero how things come to be  first in a humble glow  then a blinding white starlight that bleaches everything    There s a lesson here    But first  some background on bad questions    The Irony of Bad Questions There is an irony to bad questions  in that they can be more difficult to answer than a good question    Questioning is the art of learning    Learning to ask important questions is the best evidence of understanding there is  far surpassing the temporary endorphins of a correct “answer   ” So what makes a question bad? Well  that depends on what you think a question should “do   ” Produce a nice and tidy answer? Cause a student to reconsider a position? Force someone to go back and look more closely at how they know what they know? Assess understanding? All make sense  and a good question can do all of that    But a bad question? They halt  freeze  deflate  and derail thinking    Simply put  bad questions are confusing questions    That s not to say that good questions shouldn t be challenging  and that students might not hit a spot where they feel confused    They might    But a challenged learner and a confused learner are not the same    It s not all about “rigor” either    Bad questions can be rigorous—force learners to think on higherlevel planes—synthesis  evaluation  close analysis—and still be bad    The Hallmark of a Bad Question A bad question can be judged so because it gets at the wrong content  is full of unnecessary jargon  or is syntactically corrupt    But more than anything else  the most telling hallmark of a bad question is that it encourages learners to guess what the teacher s thinking    To try to get into the mind of the questionmaker    This  mind you  is decidedly different than understanding the mind of a clockmaker    A clock s design inspires design thinking    What that clockmaker was thinking matters    But a question maker is not a clockmaker–different  at best only a mediator between the student and content    Their intent can be noble  wellresearched  and justified  but the maker cannot—or should not–linger like a good question    There is the troubling matter of timing    Ask even the right question at the wrong time  and rather than frontloading  priming  scaffolding  or causing curiosity  students end up bewildered  their thinking scattershot  internalizing all the wrong things—social expectation  tempting recall  your relationship with them  or their own anxiety with the content    Rarely  though  do they sit with the content and its context and metacognition  but rather the bloody question and the false promise of a correct response     The Abstraction of the Question The right question at the right time can make a learning experience  because more than anything read  drawn  or even written  a question is acute and properly troubling    It creates a needlepoint of light even as it suggests darkness    Even if it s multipart and inclusive  it s somehow singular    It jabs and fingers at a learner s mind  then burrows in like a drill    A bad question is sloppy—it doesn t burrow anywhere  but bangs around and makes a troubling noise    It forces the learner to come to the question and frown and decode    Decoding can be cognitively demanding and thus helpful  but not if it mars the student s thinking    A precise  welltimed question keeps the learner in the content  in their own mind  in the mind of model thinking—in the mind of the clockmaker and not the questionmaker    A bad question also creates the illusion of an endpoint to thinking—of the student having arrived at some place where they understand the mind of the clockmaker    And when that happens  everything just kind of dissolves  and they sit passively and wait for another question  thinking they ve won    This  of course  is tragedy    The mind must never exhale  but grapple! Wrestle with a text  a concept  or a question until they ve found a new question is better suited to the task    Taking a piece of literature  an engineering problem  or an ethical issue and reducing it to a series of question is a dangerous kind of reductionism    Questions are links to other questions  and that s it    Little fragments of curiosity that get at the marrow of important issues that resonate and thrum and linger    Statements of opinion  answers  and other lies are fine  provided they move aside to let the questions through    When you ask questions—on exams  in person  in your next Socratic discussion—insist on good questions    Great questions    Model their development    Revise their wording    Toy with their tone    Simplify their syntax or implications over and over again until the confusion has been bleached and there s only thinking left    Until the question asks exactly what it should  and nothing more    Lock the students out of your head—and away from guesswhattheteacher sthinking  proficiency  false confidence  and overlysimple labels of “understanding   ” Instead  encourage them inside the mind of the clockmaker    Let them huddle  and sit in awkward silence    Let them think you re a little bit crazy    And then watch for the questions,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

60 Ways To Help Students Think For Themselves  Let them watch their predictions play out Let them form theories  and immediately test and revise those theories based on observation Give them the right collaboration with the right “mind” at the right time Allow them to read with choice–without guidelines or external pressure Let them play with content or dynamic learning tools–no goals or prompting or rules  other than basic common sense  safety  etc     Let them see the parts of the whole  and the whole of the parts Help them realize the interdependence between content and themselves Make sure they are motivated to know themselves Help them serve others  and learn to value themselves and their own human utility in the process Help guide them to write about something complex  personal  emotional  meaningful  or seemingly trite Teach them to meditate  seeing without thinking during  thinking about thinking after  Help them start with what they don t know–this will guarantee that they think for themselves  as it provides each student with their own launching pad Allow them to navigate “unfiltered” sources of information Encourage them to begin to separate basic epistemology–the differences between information  knowledge  and wisdom  for example Help them attempt to transfer understanding  prompted  Allow them to attempt to transfer understanding on their own Encourage them to believe they can  and make the choice to not be denied Allow them to practice  practice  practice in the company of some kind of feedback loop Teach them to make mistakes without blame Help them explore something they see as mysterious  untamed  or socially “disallowed” Allow them to receive learning feedback from someone just beyond their own “level” Teach them to try to find the common ground between seemingly disparate positions Encourage them to think critically about the what others perceive as mundane Make sure they think frequently about complex ideas or situations Help them to realize everything is infinitely complex when you see information as a matter of perspective  this causes an endless chain of other realizations if they re willing to consider it long enough  Encourage them to be bored and allow that boredom to “sit” Allow their mind to wander Encourage them to play video games or learning simulations Teach them to set goals with extrinsic or intrinsic rewards Help them sense an authentic need to know or understand Ask them what they stand for  and why Leave them alone Make sure they hear “something” in multiple times in multiple ways from multiple perspectives and voices Help guide them to recognize the nuance in other people s thinking Help them to honor the limits of human knowledge Encourage them to operate within their Zone of Proximal Development–the ZPD of that student for that standard  which is really  really difficult to promote consistently  Make sure they have meaningful choices at every step Make sure they are given the support to selfdirect their own learning Encourage them to make things Help them to see the value of their own performance Give them personalized direct instruction Allow them to hear a wellwritten lecture Help guide them to think about their own thinking Encourage theirs passions to lead them into spaces where learning can occur on its own Help them honor uncertainty Make sure they are able to establish their own relevancy for content Encourage them to ask their own questions–and then ask better questions Encourage opportunities for inquiry to meet a motivated mind Guide them to dynamic spaces characterized by people  thought  and creativity  rather than intricate policies  rules  and standards  Expose them to something worth doing  and is expertly gamified Help them to confront and internalize diversity and divergence Encourage them to revisit their past mistakes  thinking patterns  and moments of genius Guide them to seek selfawareness not contentawareness Help them to not take anything too seriously beyond playful curiosity Encourage them trust themselves to fail Allow them to see their own progress Guide them in studying patterns Make sure they can explain the significance of an idea  skill  or other academic topic Allow them to see or experience affectionate modeling Make sure they are mentored with love,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Question Game    A Playful Way To Teach Critical Thinking Big idea    Teaching kids to ask smart questions on their own A fouryearold asks on average about 400 questions per day  and an adult hardly asks any    Our school system is structured around rewards for regurgitating the right answer  and not asking smart questions – in fact  it discourages asking questions    With the result that as we grow older  we stop asking questions    Yet asking good questions is essential to find and develop solutions  and an important skill in innovation  strategy  and leadership    So why do we stop asking questions – and more importantly  why don t we train each other  and our future leaders  to ask the right questions starting from early on? In A More Beautiful Question    The Power of Inquiry to Spark Breakthrough Ideas Warren Berger suggests that there are three main questions which help in problem solving    Why questions  What If questions  and How questions    Regardless of the question  the question needs to be phrased openly and positively in order to achieve positive results – a closed or negative question only raises bad feelings against each other    ?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
How Google Impacts The Way Students Think  1    Google creates the illusion of accessibility  Google is powerful  the result of a complicated algorithm that attempts to index human thought that has been digitally manifest    Sounds contrived  but that s exactly what it does    And because of Google–and to an extent  social media in general–users tend to view information through that same kind of infrastructure     The result? It creates the illusion that answers are always within reach even when they re not    In fact  if users can Google answers to the questions they re given  they re likely terrible questions     2    Google naturally suggests “answers” as stopping points  When students are looking for an “answer ” good fortune sees them arrive at whatever they think they re looking for  where they can  hopefully  evaluate the quality and relevance of the information  cite their source  and be on their merry way     But with the cold logistics of software  having come what they were looking for  learners are left with the backbutton  a link on the page they re on  or a fresh browser tab    While it s not a Herculean task to return back to notes  an app  or a partner via Skype  users who Google Abuse can at times be uncertain how to apply  integrate  or synthesize their findings  making it almost useless     Having found an “answer ” rabidGooglers are ready to “finish” the assignment     Or are ready for more Googling  because Googling is easier than thinking      3    Being linear  Google obscures the interdependence of information  Since Google looks for information as destinations–go here to find this–it conditions its most frequent users to do the same    But in all of its potency  it can make opaque the process of information seeking  and more critically the relationship between data points–even those that seem to be conflicting     Especially those that seem conflicting     By ignoring the phases of inquiry learning  premature Googlers often find what they want rather than what they might need    In this way  it underscores the independence of information rather than the interdependence    Instead of looking at information and data as components of knowledge  and then understanding  it instead treats information in more binary terms    black or white  right or wrong  credible or not credible  good or bad     One Response    Information Upstarts  The funny thing is  none of this is Google s fault    Wikipedia is a perfect source of information provided you understand how sources and information work    Same with Google    In and of itself  it s literally a perfect  whole thing that does exactly what it s supposed to do    it s misunderstanding the technology itself that causes problems     The natural limitations of Google have led to a cottage industry of digital platforms that have moved past simple mass curation    These traditional social bookmarking sites like StumbleUpon  diigo  pearltrees  Scoopit  and others enable users to save information    Upstarts like lockerdome  pinterest  and others make this process niche  allowing for plucking of visual artifacts  and allowing users to organize them into infinite categories     Other apps  see Learnist  have taken this idea even further  providing more structure to how information is not only discovered  but sequenced and applied  which frankly blows any pure search engine out of the water–or at least restores it back to its proper context    a  sometimes too  simple way to find information and what others are saying about it on the way to trying to make sense of it yourself    That s it     That s search,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With the Common Core adoption in the United States  teaching vocabulary is no longer strictly the domain of the EnglishLanguage Arts classroom     While Robert Marzano has been promoting the instruction of academic vocabulary for years–and many school literacy plans have included reading and writing across the content areas for years–it is now a matter of standard and law    Which makes it kind of a big deal     And while a small portion of nonELA teachers may wonder  sometimes out loud  why they have to do “ELA teachers  jobs and their jobs too ” this is a change that s been a long time in coming    The above infographic from eyeoneducation   com offers up some simply tips in DosandDon ts format–brief enough to be practical  and simple enough for even the most novice teacher to use,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
According to the National Education Association  NEA   the number of U   S    students enrolled in special education programs has risen 30 percent over the past 10 years    Additionally  the NEA reports that nearly every general education classroom in the country includes students with disabilities  as three out of every four students with disabilities spend part or all of their school day in a general education classroom    One tool to help students with disabilities even in the face of a special education teacher shortage is assistive technology    Today  assistive technology can help students with certain disabilities learn more effectively    Ranging in sophistication from “low” technologies such as a graphic organizer worksheet to “high” technologies including cuttingedge software and smartphone apps  assistive technology is a growing and dynamic field    Several areas of assistive technology and sample products may be found in any given classroom  making a difference in how students of all abilities learn    Background On Assistive Needs & Supporting Technology  Assistive Technology Module This isn t a tech tool but a short kind of ‘course  that offers an overview of assistive technology  AT  and explores ways to expand students  access to it in the classroom Assistive Technology Act  AT Act  A summary of the Assistive Technology Act and its consequences for educators    AEM Student Summary Worksheet A resource that  for example  helps teachers “think about whether the student 1  can gain information from printbased educational materials used across the curriculum by all students  2  needs materials in a specialized format  or 3  needs modified content or alternative materials   ” TextToSpeech Assistive Tools As an assistive technology  texttospeech  TTS  software is designed to help children who have difficulties reading standard print    Common print disabilities can include blindness  dyslexia or any type of visual impairment  learning disability or other physical condition that impedes the ability to read    However  other students can benefit from TTS technology  such as children that have autism  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  ADHD  or an intellectual disability    The technology works by scanning and then reading the words to the student in a synthesized voice  using a large number of speech sounds that make up words in any given context    With the advances in speech synthesis  TTS technology is more accurate and lifelike than ever    Tech Matrix Search a database of nearly 400 products using extensive criteria tailored to assistive and educational technologies    Kurzweil 3000 The Kurzweil 3000 is a leader in TTS software for individuals that struggle with literacy    In addition to a range of TTS features  the fullfeatured software program integrates abilities that can help students in other areas  potentially appealing to those who may have a nonprint disability or those who may not typically consider a TTS program    Some of the features include     Multiple TTS voices  Support for 18 languages and dialects  Talking spellchecker  Picture dictionary graphics for more than 40 000 words  Text magnification  Tools for test taking  essay writing  notetaking  reference and more The Kurzweil 3000 strives to provide students with a multisensory approach to literacy learning    It is available for Windows and Macintosh    Graphic organizers can be effective in helping students to organize their thoughts during the writing process    As an assistive technology  graphic organizers can be a strong choice for students with dysgraphia or disorders of written expressions — particularly the conceptual aspects of writing    Graphic organizers work by helping the student map out a course of action    Depending on the type of writing  the graphic organizer can prompt the writer to describe an object  chart out a course of events or perform some other task that can help in planning the piece    Graphic organizers vary by type and technological sophistication    LowTech Handouts Graphic organizers do not need to be technologically advanced    in fact  they can exist in simple handout form    Sample handouts can be found at the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company    The sandwich chart can assist students with paragraph writing    The sequence chart can help with narrative writing and the ordering of events    The sense chart is designed for descriptive writing  where writers are prompted for terms that characterize and express an item    Dozens of other sample charts exist and can help students with virtually any type of writing    Draft   Builder Draft   Builder  is a writing tool that integrates outlining  note taking and draft writing functions to break down the writing process into three steps    Using a graphical organizer  the program helps the student visualize the project and insert information into the appropriate place without having to conceptualize the whole process    It then automates the process of creating the paper  where the student can drag and drop what is written in each note to the rough draft    Other features include a talking spell checker that uses TTS technology  a bibliography tool  a dictionary and the ability for teachers to add locked text into the program for further guidance    Draft   Builder is available for Windows and Macintosh    Assistive Listening Systems A variety of assistive listening systems  or hearing assistive technology  can help students who are deaf or hard of hearing  as well as those with other auditory and learning problems    According to the National Association for the Deaf  assistive listening systems can be used to enhance the reach and effectiveness of hearing aids and cochlear implants  or by children who do not need those tools but still need help hearing    Assistive listening systems use a microphone  a type of transmission technology and a device for capturing and bringing the sound to the ear    The specific transmission technology used in the system is typically what contrasts one type of assistive listening system from another    FM Systems According to the American SpeechLanguageHearing Association  ASHA   FM systems are the best choice for children with sensorineural hearing loss    The most common type of hearing loss for all ages  sensorineural hearing loss occurs when the inner ear  cochlea  or nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain are damaged    FM systems work using radio broadcast technology    With a transmitter microphone and a receiver  the teacher and student can maintain a consistent sound level regardless of distance and background noise    Additionally  ASHA notes that the hearing aid microphone can be turned off  so the student can concentrate on the teacher alone    SoundField Systems Soundfield systems are a strong choice for classrooms that need to assist listening for all children in the class    ASHA notes that these systems benefit not only children that have hearing loss  but those that have other auditory and learning problems  such as language delays  central auditory processing disorder  articulation disorders and development delays    Additionally  soundfield systems can be used for students who are learning English as a second language    Soundfield systems use a microphone that projects sound through mounted speakers around the classroom    In classrooms that have good acoustics  sound is able to travel evenly throughout space  eliminating problems of distance between the speaker and each listener    SipandPuff Systems Sipandpuff systems are used by students who have mobility challenges  such as paralysis and fine motor skill disabilities    These systems allow for control of a computer  mobile device or some other technological application by the child moving the device with his or her mouth    Similar to a joystick  the child can move the controller in any direction and click on various navigational tools using either a sip or a puff    An onscreen keyboard allows the child to type using the same movements    Sipandpuff systems are a type of switch device  which refers to the technology used to replace a computer keyboard or mouse    Other switch devices include buttons or other objects that a student can touch  push  pull  kick or perform some other simple action that can then control the device    Jouse3 The Jouse3 is a sipandpuff system that allows children to control a device using any part of the mouth  cheek  chin or tongue    Due to its accuracy and quick response  home users can use it for drawing or computer games    It can mount to the desktop  a bedframe or any other type of structure    it does not require a headpiece or placement on the body of the user    The product supports Windows  Macintosh  Linux and Unix based computers  in addition to Android and iOS mobile devices    It can support one or two external switches  and has two types of mouthpieces    SipandPuff Systems From Origin Instruments Origin Instruments offers a range of sipandpuff products that students can use to control an electronic device    Using a head mounted or gooseneck user interface  or available tubing for a custom solution  the child can control a mouse  joystick or keyboard with ease    The primary system is powered using USB technology    The product supports Windows  Macintosh and Linux based computers    Two pressure switches connect the system to the user interface solution for use on electronic devices    Proofreading Software Proofreading software is a branch of assistive technology that goes above and beyond the typical proofreading features found in a word processing system  such as correcting words frequently misspelled by students with dyslexia    A number of other features offered within this category can help students work on his or her English skill set to become a more effective and accurate writer    Although primarily geared towards individuals with dyslexia  proofreading software can be helpful to those with any type of learning disorder that makes writing and reading challenging    Ginger Ginger offers several features that can help students with dyslexia and other learning disorders with writing    It is also designed for speakers of languages other than English    Some of the features include     Grammar checker that analyzes context to determine any errors or misspellings    For instance  Ginger can recognize whether “there ” “their” or “they re” should be used in a sentence  which is a common mistake in writing     Word prediction and sentence rephrasing tools that can be helpful for students learning how to construct sentences properly     TTS functionality so students can hear what they ve written     A personal trainer that provides practice sessions based on past mistakes made by the student    Ginger is available for Windows and Mac  as well as iOS and Android mobile devices    Ghotit Ghotit is specifically designed for students with dyslexia and other learning disorders who have difficulties with writing    The name is inspired by the word “Ghoti ” which is a constructed term that illustrates irregularities in the English language    And since many spellings are counterintuitive — especially for those with dyslexia — Ghotit dedicates itself to assisting children and adults who struggle with writing accurately    It features the ability to learn from the user s past mistakes  personalizing suggestions for spelling and grammatical errors    Ghotit can predict words  check passages of text contextually  read text aloud using TTS technology and recognize split and merged words    It also includes an integrated dictionary for students to quickly look up a word    Math Tools A range of technology and tools can help students that have trouble with math  most commonly found in a learning disability called dyscalculia    Dyscalculia makes it difficult to grasp numbers and it is characterized by a general lack of understanding in the field of math    Assistive technology in math is not just for those with dyscalculia    It can also help students with blindness  fine motor skill disabilities or some other type of disability that makes it difficult to perform mathrelated work    MathTalk MathTalk is a speech recognition software program for math that can help students with a range of disabilities    From prealgebra to Ph   D    level mathematics  students can perform math problems by speaking into a microphone on their computer    The program works with Dragon NaturallySpeaking programs for voicetotext functionality  making it ideal for students who have fine motor skill disabilities    Students with blindness or vision disabilities can use the integrated braille translator     In addition to these audiences  MathTalk also appeals to students with dyscalculia    The program functions as an electronic math worksheet  allowing the child to organize  align and work through problems on the screen  making it helpful for students who have difficulties performing math problems on paper    Math Simulations Math simulations can help students with dyscalculia visualize math problems and concepts    As a result  students can better understand the application of a particular type of problem  since many students struggle with the conceptual aspects of math    Examples can be found at the NASA website    From video to animated simulations  teachers and students can visually see how a math concept or problem would work    And with some math simulations  students can work through the problem and then see the result play out in the simulation    Conclusion Thanks to the rapid advances in assistive technology  students  parents  and teachers have a seemingly limitless number of tools at their disposal    As these tools start to appear in the home and in the classroom  parents and teachers can utilize them for students  academic and personal growth    But technology alone is not enough – to successfully use these tools  it s critical to develop a plan for their use and have regular checkins to ensure the student is gaining the most value possible and not becoming overly reliant on these tools    But while assistive tools have become plentiful  the same cannot be said for special education instructors    As previously mentioned  the vast majority of states in the 201415 school year reported a need for teachers in special education    And many general education classrooms instruct children with special needs    Certification is a faster way for current teachers to qualify to teach this growing population    At Alvernia University Online  teachers can pursue a special education certification for grades PreK8 or 712 to help make a difference for children with special needs    They will also improve their marketability in the process  gaining additional opportunities for their career    Overall  more teachers are needed in this area    Although the advancement of technology in special education is promising  the same increase is needed for the number of special education instructors    Certification offers one solution to quickly meet this need    Learn more about Alvernia s program today,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Stage 1    Product  The Artifacts Of Learning  At the first stage of this “spectrum” of making learning visible  there is emphasis on the finished products students create    This can provide evidence of understanding  and allows other stakeholders in education an opportunity to infer what s happening in the classroom    This is also where most classrooms are today     Examples    Physical projects and models  essays  posters  blog posts  badges of completion  ribbons  letter grades  diplomas  certificates  PowerPoints  projectbased learning artifacts  photographs  Driving Question s     What compelling evidence of performance and understanding can be shared with others? What is the most authentic way to publish student work in affectionate and attentive communities?  Stage 2    Process  The Patterns & Sequence Of Learning  As we make learning visible during this second stage  the process and sequence of learning is illuminated    This may include ongoing or even finished projects shared  but only insofar as student habits  decisions  developing understanding  and ongoing performance are concerned    This helps students see understanding as alive–and thus capable of growth or decay–and always evolving     This also helps schools and teachers see student performance as an extraordinarily individual and often chaotic–even Rhizomatic–journey  and design curriculum  assessment  learning feedback  and other systems around that idea     Examples    Any practices that encourage metacognition  journaling about the Habits of Mind  making room for failure  revisiting old work for reflection or improvement  entrepreneurship projects  including community projects and businesses   visual data that shows change over time  returning to “places”  physical or digital  of learning  the iteration of digital portfolios  rather than the artifacts themselves   reflecting on what students felt emotionally during the process of learning  Driving Question s     What does “personalized learning” mean? How do students learn differently–both in a standardized curriculum  and in a model where each student learns something different? How can the nature of learning as a process be made visible–and in a way that serves the student as much as those around them?  Stage 3     Need To Know  The Reason For Learning  At this advanced stage of making learning visible  knowledge demands and curiosity are the focus    Here  what students need to know is supplemented–and empowered–by why they need to know it    These two concepts work together to bolster both curiosity and the utility of knowledge     Driving Question s     How can the need to know be communicated  emphasized  and published? What role does curiosity play? What is the difference between “engaged academic” and “authentic learning”?  Examples    Informal learning  demonstrated curiosity  problembased learning  challengebased learning  visible transfer of knowledge  communal constructivism  selfdirected learning as a classroom model  Stage 4    The Self  The Context For Learning  The last of these socalled “stages” of making learning visible finishes with the student themselves    A continuum that began with the idea of students proving themselves to others by what they “do” has now transformed into one that focuses on the students themselves as a context for learning–what they learn  why the learn it  and what they do with what they know     Some of these kinds of questions can be found in our selfdirected learning model  including     What problems or opportunities are within my reach? What important problems & solutions have others before me created? What legacies am I a part of & what does that suggest that I understand? For me  in this light  what s worth understanding? Examples    Selfdirected learning as a classroom model  placebased education  learning through play  Driving Question s     How is each child different? How are each child s knowledge demands unique? In what contexts do students both need to know and then–unprompted–use what they know?  The next question to address  which I ll do in a followup  is whom are we sharing the above with  and how?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4 Things Every Student Should Do Every Day 1    Every day  students should give more than they ‘get     Every day  students should leave school feeling cognitive stretched and intellectually agitated    Changed    And for this to be sustainable over time  a critical component of the InsideOut Learning Model   it has to come not from teachers  but students themselves    This isn t a new idea    There are other efforts that either paraphrase or support his effort    For years  teachers have been admonished to ‘never work harder than the students     Progressive education often refers to the shift for the role of the teacher from the ‘sage on stage  to the ‘guide on the side     Suggesting that students ‘be the loudest voices in the room  is parallel here  too    Students should create  practice  collaborate  and design–more than they ‘sit and get     And so on    The big idea here is shifting the roles between teachers and students–and not just ‘holding students accountable  any more than school districts seeks to ‘hold teachers accountable     Rather  this about tone and climate    Perspective    And this can  in part  be accomplished by empowering students through selfdirection  process ownership  cognitive engagement  and meaningful autonomy    One Strategy    Use ProjectBased Learning to center–and empower–students in your classroom    You can also contact TeachThought Professional Developmentif you re looking for more enduring and substantial in your classroom  school  or district    One Resource    5 Levels of Student Ownership 2    Every day  students should ask more questions than they answer    Why should students ask more questions than they answer? Of course  quantity isn t the point    But merely insisting on quality isn t enough  either    More than anything else  a student s tendency to consistently ask more–and better–questions is an indicator of not only ‘student engagement   but of curiosity  ownership  autonomy  and hope     Imagine a student with no confidence or hope consistently asking great questions    It s unlikely     One Strategy    How can you help students ask more questions than they answer? Start small    Maybe they can simply improve their questions–start with a question and make it better    And in a perfect world  they ll do this on their own  unprompted  using their own questions they asked to begin with    In the meantime  you may have to help them practice this skill in a cognitive  i   e     their ability to do so  and behavioral  i   e     their will and tendency to do so     Read 10 Ways To Honor Mistakes In The Learning Process 10 Strategies To Promote Curiosity In Learning How The Memory Works In Learning One Resource    An Updated Guide For Questioning In The Classroom 3    Transfer what they know from the classroom to their lives    Because if they don t  what s the point of it all? One Strategy    Learning journals that help students think  where students take a few minutes each day or night to reflect on the transferability of the knowledge they acquired and/or their tendency to do so     And if they can t do either  this is a great starting point to talk about curriculum  assessment  instruction  and so on in your school and district     One Resource    14 Ways Students Can Transfer What They Know 4    Every day  students should feel a sense of progress and hope    In other words  grow    Progress and hope won t always be equal or even clear    Some days  they both might be scarce    But any day that passes when a student feels no confidence  hope  improvement  or growth is a failure by everyone and thing who could ve made it otherwise    Of course  ‘hope  is a vague concept that thankfully extends well beyond the classroom    The possibility of educating children with no hope  for today or the future  is a sobering one    And ideally  progress in the classroom yields a sense of hope at home if the relationship between curriculum and living is sufficiently direct    One Strategy    How can you help students feel a sense of hope and progress? Part of this is will be owed to the nature and quality of the learning feedback they are given on a daily basis  which is difficult    On a broader level  to really help students feel a sense of progress of hope requires a collaboration between curriculum and instruction that s beyond the scope of this post    For now  simply try to visualize their progress over time    Pick one skill or ‘facet  of their education and be creative    It could be attendance  literacy  test scores  participation in group work  meeting personal goals  etc    For now  it s all about seeing progress    You could also use gamification or even grade backward    Even ask the students for ideas     See #1 above     Keep in mind  this doesn t have to be an ambitious effort    Instead  worry about the tone and effect of that effort over time in a sustainable way,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is what happens when students turn in incomplete assignments    Incomplete assignments only give a partial snapshot of student ability    We might only see their ability to answer surface questions and not see that they are capable of probing the deeper nuances of a given content area–literature  world civilizations  or the scientific process    The biggest need for any teacher is having a clear view of what students can and cannot accomplish    This knowledge is our guide and signpost for helping our students     So  how can we get that data accurately when students aren t completing the work? When students come to you with incomplete work there are a couple of options you have     You can simply take the work     I did this for years and found myself getting frustrated with students  lack of care    Yes  I took it personally sometimes      You can reiterate why you need the work completed and leave it up to the student whether to do it or not     I also tried this    Most of the time  kids chose not to do the work and then I would feel the same feelings I experienced in number 1      You can hand it back for completion     I ve found the most effective of these three techniques is the third strategy    Of course  I reiterate why I need the assignment  but handing the assignment back for completion with the express understanding that the grade remains a zero until I receive a completed assignment motivates kids to complete the work     It s one of those holy grails in education that had me wondering why I d never done it before—what took me so long? Once students hand you half completed work and you hand it back immediately for completion  and this happens a couple of times  an amazing thing happens    students learn not to hand in incomplete work    I say  “I can t accept incomplete work   ”  The key here is to hand the assignment back immediately    I quickly scan what kids turn in to me as they turn it in and can catch the assignments that need more work    It s not a perfect system and kids do periodically fudge their answers just to get the work in  but I ve still gotten more out of them than they were initially willing to give     Ultimately  incomplete work doesn t really give us anything    It s important to keep the dialogue open with students about why you re doing what you re doing and to have a clear understanding of expectations    I tell my kids all the time that I want a complete picture of their abilities and most of the time they re willing to give it,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How can you help students see their own progress? And use that to motivate them?  Encouragement mechanics–a kind of gamification–is one approach    And note  you needn t make that lesson or unit feel like a ‘video game     That s not gamification    Gamification is simply the application of gamelike mechanics to ‘nongames      So here  we d be taking a lesson from games and applying them to student progress    One of the most obvious ways to do this would be to create learning badges are pretty cool     On the surface  they seem a bit like the gold stars of yesteryear  and they are–but they re better    A badge is simply a visual icon that represents something–a talent  skill  achievement  etc    Kind of like Scout badges  but digital  and completely customizable per student  teacher  or classroom     Like encouragement mechanics  learning badges often get confused with gamification as well when in fact they are just strategies that can be used to realize gamification    Gamification–making a “game” out of something that s not–is different    The effect is a kind of encouragement mechanic that helps students see their own progress    Put another way  seeing one s progress is a strategy for encouragement     Put another way  seeing one s progress is a strategy for encouragement     But they don t have to be used to encouraged    they can be used to uncover  reveal  and emphasize    In How Gamification Uncovers Nuance In The Learning Process  I explained the benefit     “A digital trophy system–if welldesigned–offers the ability to make transparent not just success and failure  accolades and demerits  but every single step in the learning process that the gamification designer chooses to highlight    Every due date missed  peercollaborated with  sentence revised  story revisited  every step of the scientific process and longdivision  every original analogy  tightlydesigned thesis statement  or exploration of pushpull factors–every single time these ideas and more can be highlighted for the purposes of assessment  accountability  and student selfawareness   ”  This is all oversimplified  of course    How to actually manage this on a daily basis in your classroom is an altogether different beast    But I thought it might be helpful to consider themes and categories as innovative strategies to begin thinking out how they might work for you     And to be clear–they don t have to be digital badges    Think of a letter grade as the most crude and misleading and basic learning badge ever created  then work up from there    What else could you create to help students publish their skills  see their own progress  and grow in your classroom?  7 Categories For Creating Learning Badges For Students  And The Don t Even Have To Be Digital   1    Quantity  e   g     solved this many equations in this amount of time  read this many books over this window of time   2    Quality  e   g     demonstrated this criteria of quality in this projectbased learning activity   3    Collaboration  improved this product in this specific way using collaboration   4    Diversity  e   g     published on these sites or in these genres across these audiences   5    Depth  e   g     demonstrated understanding at this level of Bloom s Taxonomy in this activity   6    Mastery  e   g     demonstrated mastery of this standard via this kind of assessment   7    Personal Habits  e   g     demonstrated use of this Habit of Mind   Conclusion  As you can see  the possibilities are endless    And with free resources like badgestack  all that s left is pick a way to get started     I d start small—maybe 3 badges in a single unit students can earn—a very “whole class ” carrot stick approach     But as you build an understanding of how it can work  instead of using them as encouragement mechanics  you can instead use them to amplify the performance of the students to all stakeholders  blowing away the letter grade as the crude  impotent  singular badge that it is,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The gift of my fifth year of teaching was patience     Every year something new occurs to me as an educator  and for year five it was the insurmountable scale of process    This was partly a response to beginning to see the things that were in my control  and the things that were not    To see the sequence between this thing and that place with that student clarified it all quickly     All year I worked with my students to loosen them and wake them up—to get them agile and responsive and able to move laterally in their learning as they consider task  purpose  technology  and place    To look first inside themselves  and move outward from there     On a daily basis  I fought my instincts to plan and control and cause  and their instincts to be ‘finished   listless  and compliant    There were times I thought we were dead in the water  but a few months ago they started to respond  and just in the last few weeks started moving through ideas and projects faster than I can chase them     Which is exactly what I want     So many times I almost quit    I blamed culture  literacy  technology  myself  Minecraft  Justin Bieber  and everything else that didn t jive with my ‘vision     But it was growing the whole time–I just couldn t see it because I wasn t looking in the right place     As a teacher  you may come across a strategy  technology  or learning model that knocks your socks off  only to give it a shot and be underwhelmed at the results    It very well could be that you ve got a bad idea     But it also might be that you re teaching students so accustomed to other ways that everything you say sounds like crazy talk    That you teach on a ‘data team  that wants you to be more streamlined—to teach just like they do    That you re trying to lead an entire school of fish upstream  which is real work     Trust yourself to figure to know when to cut your losses  and when to stick it out     For one  there is always an implementation dip–a period after integration when things go south    Whatever you re trying to accomplish  you probably don t fully understand this “great new thing” as well as you think you do    Which means you probably explain it clumsily  use it inefficiently  and aren t sure how to troubleshoot when things go awry     Like your students  you need time as well     In an era of pressure  maps  PLCs  and pacing guides  forgive yourself for not having all the answers    For learning on the job    For not being able to fully explain why a student is struggling    This doesn t excuse “accountability ” but rather honors the teaching and learning process as something greater than the scientific collision of students and standards     Rather than an excuse  patience can keep you from overreacting    It can force you to sit with the assessment design  or assessment results just a bit longer to see if something reveals itself    It can keep stress from shutting down your creative thinking and resorting to crazypanicked teacher mode where no one wins and you re exhausted     All of education may seem like it is trying to exert its will on your classroom    Let it push     You ve got work that is both creative and scientific    Human and technologybased    Two minds that can t possibly be rushed     You re growing things  after all,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
We love and encourage collaborative work between students  and teachers  and this is a staple in projectbased learning to be sure    it can be a powerful tool to build capacity and skills in a number of ways but it can also be problematic    One of the inevitabilities in the group or teamwork teachers often use in schools is the difference in how much each group member is contributing to the ongoing work    There are a few ways to counter this and help students grow in the process    Outside of the typical ‘I don t like him/her  complaint  higher achieving students frequently protest  often quietly  because they feel like they re doing more work than some or all of their group    They re often right    Parents complain because their child tells them they are shouldering more of the load than what is fair and sometimes that load gets pushed to the parents    For those who are concerned about their grades the usual response is to complain behind the scenes but go ahead and do the extra work to avoid a poor score    So how do we hold students accountable for their contribution  work  growth  and learning in a way that is equitable and builds collaboration and communication skills at the same time? Start with group/team contracts    Student contracts can be used as a sort of rubric for collaboration expectations and norms and I encourage student voice in creating them as much as possible    It can be helpful to provide a starting point  even a template  for students to modify and/or add to instead of creating this contract from scratch    The template might include guiding questions like    ? What do we expect of each other? ? How will we know we re pulling our weight? ? What will happen when one or more of us doesn t meet the group s expectations? The idea is to establish a guide for quality collaboration and procedures for dealing with the possibility of someone not meeting expectations    In our PBL Project Design Rubric  we re striving to help “…students move toward autonomously managing the process” and this contract should include some due process for group members to manage for “slackers” prior to the teacher stepping in    Sure  you might need to monitor and facilitate some of that conversation but we want students to shoulder as much of that as they are capable of     If the group or teamwork is taking place over a longer period of time or involves multiple steps or pieces consider requiring groups use tools like a task management log  work plan  and/or reflection logs of work completed    If we re replicating actual workplace environments we might see this in practice as tools like Slack    The idea is a clear way to communicate about who is responsible for what  when it s due  and when it s been done    In a PBL setting  we might call these milestones and they are often tied to our formative assessments    Finally  when the work or project is done and it s time to divvy up the points consider a system that rewards those who pulled their weight and perhaps some of the weight of the “slackers”    Awarding the same amount of points or the same grade to all group members regardless of contribution creates resentment and frustration so why do it? Instead  I like scoring the group as a whole and then giving them a form like the one below where they have to divide the points up according to the work and value added    Those students who did what was expected of them  or more  should get more points than those who didn t but the total has to add up to the overall group score multiplied by the number of group members    Again  my goal is to move towards students autonomously managing the process so I suggest having them talk through this process on their own as much as possible    It is important  of course  to modify for age level and situation    There may be a group member who tries to bully the others or doesn t have an accurate sense of their contribution and this is where the teacher/facilitator steps in as much as needed to keep problematic conflicts from occurring    Sometimes students will express discomfort with having these hard conversations but I think they re vital learning opportunities when supported well by the teacher/facilitator    For younger grades and in some situations you might make them anonymous or other similar modifications but in the end  the idea is that students are rewarded for the work they contributed  including the slackers    Looking for example contracts?

1    Feedback should be educative in nature     Providing feedback means giving students an explanation of what they are doing correctly AND incorrectly     However  the focus of the feedback should be based essentially on what the students is doing right     It is most productive to a student s learning when they are provided with an explanation and example as to what is accurate and inaccurate about their work    Use the concept of a “feedback sandwich” to guide your feedback    Compliment  Correct  Compliment    2    Feedback should be given in a timely manner     When feedback is given immediately after showing proof of learning  the student responds positively and remembers the experience about what is being learned in a confident manner     If we wait too long to give feedback  the moment is lost and the student might not connect the feedback with the action    3    Be sensitive to the individual needs of the student    It is vital that we take into consideration each student individually when giving feedback     Our classrooms are full of diverse learners     Some students need to be nudged to achieve at a higher level and other needs to be handled very gently so as not to discourage learning and damage selfesteem    A balance between not wanting to hurt a student s feelings and providing proper encouragement is essential    4    Ask the 4 questions    Studies of effective teaching and learning  Dinham  2002  2007a    2007b  have shown that learners want to know where they stand in regards to their work     Providing answers to the following four questions on a regular basis will help provide quality feedback     These four questions are also helpful when providing feedback to parents    ? What can the student do? ? What can t the student do? ? How does the student s work compare with that of others? ? How can the student do better? 5    Feedback should reference a skill or specific knowledge     This is when rubrics become a useful tool     A rubric is an instrument to communicate expectations for an assignment     Effective rubrics provide students with very specific information about their performance  comparative to an established range of standards    For younger students  try highlighting rubric items that the student is meeting or try using a sticker chart    6    Give feedback to keep students “on target” for achievement    Regular ‘checkins  with students lets them know where they stand in the classroom and with you     Utilize the ‘4 questions  to guide your feedback    7    Host a oneonone conference    Providing a oneonone meeting with a student is one of the most effective means of providing feedback     The student will look forward to having the attention and allows the opportunity to ask necessary questions     A oneonone conference should be generally optimistic  as this will encourage the student to look forward to the next meeting    As with all aspects of teaching  this strategy requires good time management     Try meeting with a student while the other students are working independently     Time the meetings so that they last no longer than 10 minutes    8    Feedback can be given verbally  nonverbally or in written form     Be sure to keep your frowns in check    It is imperative that we examine our nonverbal cues    Facial expressions and gestures are also means of delivering feedback     This means that when you hand back that English paper  it is best not to scowl    9    Concentrate on one ability     It makes a far greater impact on the student when only one skill is critiqued versus the entire paper being the focus of everything that is wrong     For example  when I taught Writer s Workshop at the elementary level  I would let students know that for that day I was going to be checking on the indentation of paragraphs within their writing     When I conferenced with a student  that was my focus instead of all the other aspects of their writing     The next day would feature a new focus    10    Alternate due dates for your students/classes     Utilize this strategy when grading papers or tests    This strategy allows you the necessary time to provide quality  written feedback     This can also include using a rotation chart for students to conference with at a deeper more meaningful level     Students will also know when it is their turn to meet with you and are more likely to bring questions of their own to the conference    11    Educate students on how to give feedback to each other     Model for students what appropriate feedback looks like and sounds like     As an elementary teacher  we call this ‘peer conferencing      Train students to give each other constructive feedback in a way that is positive and helpful     Encourage students to use postit notes to record the given feedback    12    Ask another adult to give feedback     The principal at the school I taught at would often volunteer to grade history tests or read student s writing pieces     You can imagine how the student s quality of work increased tenfold!  If the principal is too busy  and most are   invite a ‘guest  teacher or student teacher to critique work    13    Have the student take notes     During a conference over a test  paper or a general ‘check in   have the student do the writing while you do the talking    The student can use a notebook to jot down notes as you provide the verbal feedback    14    Use a notebook to keep track of student progress    Keep a section of a notebook for each student     Write daily or weekly  dated comments about each student as necessary     Keep track of good questions the student asks  behavior issues  areas for improvement  test scores etc     Of course this requires a lot of essential time management but when it is time to conference with a student or parent  you are ready to go    15    Return tests  papers or comment cards at the beginning of class      Returning papers and tests at the beginning of class  rather than at the end  allows students to ask necessary questions and to hold a relevant discussion    16    Use PostIt notes    Sometimes seeing a comment written out is more effective than just hearing it aloud    During independent work time  try writing feedback comments on a postit note    Place the note on the student s desk the feedback is meant for     One of my former students had a difficult time staying on task but he would get frustrated and embarrassed when I called him out on his inattentive behaviors in front of the class    He would then shut down and refused to do any work because he was mad that I humiliated him     I resorted to using postit notes to point out when he was on task or not     Although it was not the most effective use of my time  it really worked for him    17    Give genuine praise     Students are quick to figure out which teachers use meaningless praise to win approval    If you are constantly telling your students “Good Job” or “Nice Work” then  over time  these words become meaningless     Make a big deal out of a student s A+ on that vocabulary test     If you are thrilled with a student s recent ontask behaviors  go above and beyond with the encouragement and praise    Make a phone call home to let mom or dad know how thrilled you are with the student s behavior    Comments and suggestions within genuine feedback should also be ‘focused  practical and based on an assessment of what the student can do and is capable of achieving   Dinham     18     “I noticed…   ” Make an effort to notice a student s behavior or effort at a task     For example    “I noticed when you regrouped correctly in the hundreds column  you got the problem right   ” “I noticed you arrived on time to class this entire week   ”  Acknowledging a student and the efforts they are making goes a long way to positively influence academic performance    19    Provide a model or example    Communicate with your students the purpose for an assessment and/or feedback     Demonstrate to students what you are looking for by giving them an example of what an A+ paper looks like     Provide a contrast of what a C paper looks like     This is especially important at the upper learning levels    20    Invite students to give YOU feedback    Remember when you finished a class in college and you were given the chance to ‘grade  the professor?  How nice was it to finally tell the professor that the reading material was so incredibly boring without worrying about it affecting your grade? Why not let students give you feedback on how you are doing as a teacher? Make it so that they can do it anonymously    What did they like about your class? What didn t they like? If they were teaching the class  what would they do differently? What did they learn the most from you as a teacher? If we are open to it  we will quickly learn a few things about ourselves as educators    Remember that feedback goes both ways and as teachers it is wise to never stop improving and honing our skills as teachers,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We ve had some great times  and done some cool things we ll never forget    Like that time in the summer PD where all the department teachers got together and sketched out their idea of a perfect unit  and made it happen     And it was glorious—backwardsplanning was used from the beginning    Understanding was preassessed  data drove revision of planned instruction    Parents showed up for presentation of the final project  and the kids showed real grit and progress getting through it all    The unit functioned as a kind of metaphor for life—requiring planning  collaboration  and good oldfashioned perseverance to navigate    And in the end  the Yoga is about the journey     But then things started to feel funny    When it came time for testing  students were being assessed on standards they focused on six months ago in the second unit of the school year    To mitigate any ill effects here  we used instructional design and curriculum mapping tricks    We did reviews via bellringers  and used yearlong testing to keep them sharp and remind us what they still needed help with     We even did pretesting “blitzes” of content  but then the state shut that down too    Said it was cheating    So we figured out other ways to help—charts on the wall  special class periods of remediation and review    Still  it didn t feel like enough    Some units took twice as long as planned to finish  and even then the triumph was often in that finish rather than the understanding    Pacing guides were issued to help mitigate this  and an array of curriculum maps and scopeandsequences to ensure everyone was on the same page  learning the same thing  sharing the same “datadriven” and “researchbased” ways     But then the data—my word  the data    So much data  pouring in from everywhere    ACT testing  Explore testing  PSAT testing  reading level testing  inclass assessment testing  all screaming the same thing    The kids have trouble reading  the kids have trouble thinking critically  the kids have trouble planning their writing     As if you didn t know      So you dutifully wagged the manila folders with you to data team meetings  and stared at the bar graphs your local instructional coach keeps emailing you trying to figure out how to get all of this data to actually do something besides berate you    So you start attempting to personalize the learning via the data    You make some adjustments—frontload this student with more thinking strategies  group students more intentionally  and see a bit of progress     But it s oddly hollow  because the unit isn t built for this     Where The Unit Fails  The unit is a structure  like a circuit of roadways through a city  with the beginning on one side  where each student is   and the ending on the other  what we want them to understand     Just like in a real city  those pathways are necessarily complex and even chaotic viewed from Google Earth    Trying to funnel the users down predetermined pathways will ensure you get from here to there—that is  get through the city—but it limits what the data can do     The data can t properly function because it means moving backwards and forwards  stopping and starting slowing down and speeding up–all things that happen in learning  and all things units aren t good at     And perhaps worse  it puts the weight of the world on the shoulders of a classroom teacher doing their best to soothe so many seemingly divergent efforts    A teacher try to consistently—and substantively–incorporate data into planned instruction is like trying to fill a drinking glass with rain    Or trying to herd millions of people through a city s strangled concrete infrastructure     It s time to replace the unit with something smarter    In the 21st century  there are alternatives    Existing popular trends like projectbased learning  blended learning  and even informal learning all offer the skeleton of far more manageable solutions that  by design  can support teachers in absorbing the data they are being asked to use     If we insist on an outcomesbased  researchbased  datadriven ed reform  the traditional unit—at least in its current guise—has no business in our classrooms    Teachers are sentimental folk—we ve grown weary of buzz and trends  and the unit feels comfortable    Like an old friend    Something we could count on when we re told everything we ve ever done has been wrong     But we ll get through this together    There are solutions  and we ll talk about those    And new apps    And new thinking    And we can hang the unit in the educational hall of fame beside the abacus  textbook  and chalkboard where it can function forever as a symbol of how far we ve come,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Metaphors  similes  and analogies  using them to teach complex ideas–“a thesis statement is the _____ of an essay a…”    “The Civil Rights movement was like…”    RAFT assignments    Choice boards     Be picky     7    Never take it personally     Teaching is a deeply human endeavor and so of course it s natural to ‘take it personal     By all means  do so    But as much as possible  endeavor to be a professional in the same way a surgeon is    While surgeons undoubtedly care about their patients because they care they have to be professional  calculated  and objective    You never know what a student is going through  or ‘where they are  in their development as human beings    Have a short memory  and be their best chance to become something great     6    The students should talk more than you do     This one s easy to forget  especially when you have so much to teach    There s the shift though–try to focus on what students are learning and how  rather than what ‘you re teaching      5    How you frame your thinking is everything     This isn t much different than a relationship  marriage  money  or any other career     You can t teach if you re exhausted  misinformed  too hard on yourself  disconnected  or misunderstand your role in some critical way  as a colleague  a peer  a teacher  a department leader  etc     It s not your job to save the world    Every child needs something different    In response  try to adopt learning models  tools  teaching strategies  and more–and use them in a way that doesn t require superhuman effort from you to make it work     They should work harder than you do     4    You re a professional and you control your own attitude     You see what you want to see  so choose to see and assume the best in people and circumstances  and move forward from there    Schools can be places full of bad policies and absurd bureaucracy    You probably can t change most of that  so focus on what you can change–and that starts with how you think     The students are always watching you    How you treat people  even the “problem students     how you show compassion or model accountability    Where you go for resources    How you define ‘success     What you do when you re frustrated or upset    Your dedication and craft and expertise    They may not see it all every single time  but they never stop watching     This means your voice carries on outside the classroom  where they ll continue to talk about you–for years to come if you ve done it well     3    How you make students feel can last a lifetime    Careful      You are a larger thanlifefigure to most students    You re a teacher–you may be the loudest voice in their already busy mind    Consider the character you play in that mind accordingly    Further  how you frame students in your mind absolutely changes how you ll think about and respond to and teach students     2    It s not your job to prepare students for ‘the real world      Holding their feet to the fire for a deadline? Refusing to let them retake an exam? Requiring them to work with students they don t begin to work well with? And doing so under the guise of “the real world”? For it to be successful  school should be the exact opposite of these characteristics we cherry pick from ‘life      It should be a time to help them learn from mistakes    a place that helps protect them from themselves    a chance for them to adopt mindsets based on love and growth  not fear and policy    While this doesn t excuse accountability measures for students  the big idea is clear    School is there for the students  students aren t there for the school     If we want a better world  we can t continue to mirror the worst parts of that world into our classrooms     1    Find your thing     We all have to have our ‘thing  as educators    Whatever ‘it  is  it s equal parts identity  purpose  love  and curiosity    Whether it s the students  your craft  your content  your community  or something else entirely–be clear in your own mind about why you do what you do  and never let it go,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1    Maker Spaces How this is structured depends on your space  content area  grade level  etc    But any content area can use “making” as a primary teaching and learning strategy  and to do so  you ll need to create the spaces for that to happen    A mix of the “Learning Labs” approach and the “Google Room” may work well     2    Geometric Mix This approach takes a mix of forms–rows  groups  semicircled tables    While the furniture in the pic above may be beyond your reach  you can produce a similar effect with a combination of tables and desks    3    Differentiation Stations* This is physical grouping  but based on areas of differentiation–background knowledge  reading level  an individual skill  etc    If instruction is tailored for a student in this way–with their Zone of Proximal development–there is more opportunity for thinking  teaching  and learning that “fits   ”  4    Fishbowl* Also a teaching strategy  Fishbowls sees a group of students in the middle  and a group on the outside in a circle facing the group in the middle    You can also arrange your classroom this way permanently–or at least for an extended period of time    The “fish” in the middle have one function  e   g     reading roles from a play  solving a problem  analyzing art  etc     while the group on the outside participates in a #backchannel twitter chat with a love running log on a screen    Here  everyone can have a voice–and an opportunity for thought    5    One Group + 4 Rows This one is what it sounds like it d be–one group complemented by 4 rows    This setup could be useful if the majority of the class is often working on one activity–or part of an activity  while the bulk of the class works on something else    It obviously can be used collaboratively as well     6    2 Groups + 2 Rows Same as above  but more of the class is in a group this time  so the class is split more evenly    7    Function Pods* This one is similar to Differentiation Stations  only the idea here is less about differentiation and more about a task    Think literature circles  for example  where everyone has a role    The difference here is that the whole classroom is set up that way    8    A ‘Google Room *  Think colors    Lots of colors    Shapes and textures  too    Diverse lighting sources    A lot of natural light  if possible    Areas to work alone  in pairs  or in groups    Sitting    Standing    Openness    Collaboration    May not be possible to realize completely  but you could use it as inspiration    9    Two Sides* You can also split the classroom into “two sides   ” This may be comprised of rows  but the room is set up in halves oftentimes facing one another    This can be especially effective for Social Studies classes  or other content areas that use Accountable Talk as a teaching strategy    You can also have the two sides comprised of angled rows    This isn t a huge change from traditional rows  but it does offer a few advantages if you ve got the room  namely that students are in the line of sight of one another more naturally    10    Giant Oval Usually  this is used for teambuilding activities  but it s possible to run a classroom this way for a full unit if you plan for it effectively    Maybe a steady diet of agree/disagree  debate  Socratic Seminars  and Accountable Talk  for example    11    Teacher In The Middle Picture a “regular classroom ” but with the teacher  and their desk  if they have one  in the middle    Changes the dynamic of the classroom quite a bit    Whether that s an effective teaching tool or not depends on how you use it  the same goes with all of these  I suppose     12    Standing Desks  They re out there    Write a grant proposal  put your desk in the middle  and make it work    13    Horseshoe An oval with one end missing    Kind of    Not sure this would be very effective longterm  but for a reading activity or a writearound  which are terribly underrated as teaching strategies   it d work swimmingly    14    Two Circles Circles allow students to face one another and encourage conversation    It s not ideal for small group work  but fordirectn instruction and literacy activities  it has potential    One giant circle may not work well for a daily setup  but two circles might    With two circles  the size is obviously reduced compared to one  giving you a bit more flexibility for classroom management    15    Rotating Groups* This is less about the shape of the desks  and more about the workflow and lesson design    The idea here is to plan lessons and units that require students to work together with different groups for different reasons  and to keep them moving  whether within one class  one week  or the unit overall    16    Middle Circle  Outer Square Putting a square on the outside and circle on the inside–or even viceversa–is really just a ‘geometric variation  of the fishbowl  but the size of the circle can be adapted for daily use by a large cluster of students    17    Learning Labs* If you can recall back to the high school science lab–high desks  “things” to tinker with  students standing and moving around small areas of collaborative learning space–that s the idea of learning labs    This can be used in any content area and any grade level  and doesn t even necessarily require handson manipulatives    Students standing around a high desk solving physics or geometry problems while “mixing” isn t a management nightmare if you ve planned a lesson with this approach in mind    18    A Learning Studio* This is a nontraditional learning environment–imagine a Starbucks mixed with a library mixed with a classroom mixed with a maker space mixed with a design studio    Probably wouldn t work if you have 35 students  but if you have less than 20  this kind of approach could change the culture of learning in your classroom    19    Open Square Similar to #10  this one came on twitter from @rmg178  “I do an open square with the open side facing the board & I put a table in the middle for my materials   ” 20    Fluid Change it up weekly    Let the learning goals dictate how you use your space–and how students use their individual spaces    A fixed learning space reflects a fixed mindset    It s not “a lot of work ” it s adapting,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Is the assessment for the teacher or the student? If you re not clear about why you re assessing  and what you re going to do with the data the assessment provides  you re wasting a lot of time  energy  and resources–your own and that of the students     Think like a doctor    You have to have a plan what you re going to do with what you learn from the assessment  the data  before you give the assessment–ideally  before you even design the assessment to begin with     The Difference Between Assessment Of Learning And Assessment For Learning  Assessment for learning is commonly referred to as formative assessment–that is  assessment designed to inform instruction    If we can agree that the purpose of assessment is to provide data to revise planned instruction  then the only type of assessment that s not ‘assessment for learning  is ‘assessment of learning   commonly referred to as summative assessment     Assessment is generally broken down into three categories    assessment before instruction  preassessment   assessment during instruction  formative assessment   and assessment after instruction  summative assessment     To further complicate matters  it could be argued that preassessment is both assessment of and for learning–that is  it assesses ‘prior knowledge   as a preassessment  and that data is then used to revise planned instruction  making it formative assessment      In truth  most of this is semantics and a bit confusing    There are many ways to measure understanding and the primary distinction in most K12 classrooms for most assessments is function    What is the assessment supposed to do? If you re using the ‘test  so that you can see what students do and don t know so that you can more accurately plan future learning lessons and activities  then it s assessment for learning  even if you re obviously doing so by performing an assessment of learning      If instead  the assessment is merely a kind of benchmark to see ‘how well they can do  and you re moving on  then it s primarily an assessment of learning    There is significant overlap between the two    in fact  the same test given in one circumstance would be considered an assessment of learning while in another circumstance be considered an assessment for learning     In short then  the difference between assessment of learning and assessment for learning is a matter of function and purpose–a matter of ‘who     assessment of learning is a way to see what the students can do while assessment for learning is a way to see what the teachers should do in response     You can check out more of TeachThought s assessment resources for teachers or contact us for assessment professional development  and let us know in the comments if there is a distinction or example you think other teachers could benefit from,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
As a certified massage therapist for over two decades  in addition to my roles as a teacher and coach  I have seen firsthand the impact of stress on the body     Some research has shown that as many as 75–90 percent of primary care physician visits are due to stressrelated problems    This is a significant problem to address  especially in the education profession    recent studies have shown that educators have higher rates of stress and depression when compared to the general population  and 67 percent of teachers stated that their stress level increased during the course of the 201617 school year  an alarming trend    Now more than ever  educators at all levels need a clear  proactive approach to handling and managing stress     I often hear educators explain that they just don t have time to work out or engage in other stress management activities    But  as the CEO?Chief Emotional Officer?of the classroom  we set the mood and create the climate    Our stress management  or lack thereof  doesn t affect only our health    there are implications for every student in our care    Put simply  we can t afford to ignore opportunities to reduce our stress     When I was still in the classroom  I certainly had times that I didn t do as good of a job carving out “me time   ” What I found was that the more stressed I was  the less patience I had with my students and colleagues    Heck  our own spouses  partners  kids  and pets become far less adorable as our stress levels increase!  Part of great leadership?and  believe me  every educator in the school is a leader?is doing everything possible to be the best version of ourselves  day in and day out    Modeling selfcare and taking definitive steps to maintain a healthy lifestyle will ensure that our bodies are fighting the impact of stress  giving us the best opportunity to remain diseasefree and to have a positive impact on our peers and students     Why now is the time to get started  There is a mile of blood vessels in every pound of fat    A MILE    It requires a lot of effort for your heart to pump blood through that vast network  even in the best of circumstances    Unfortunately  according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey  two in three U   S    adults are considered overweight or obese    Even five pounds of extra fat can increase blood pressure and stress on the heart  so reversing this trend can go a long way     Stress is a major factor in weight gain so  when it comes to managing stress and its related health challenges  addressing stress and weight together is a great place to start    Acknowledge your starting point  as well as your goals for a few months down the road     If you re not yet convinced of the benefits of a healthy lifestyle?complete with consistent exercise  nourishing food  and supportive relationships?and the relevance of these factors to success in your professional life  take a quick look at just a few     Lower blood pressure Improved sleep  digestion  mood  and energy Strengthened immune system Stronger heart and bones Improved focus  patience  and productivity Consider this your official “kick in the pants” from my size 11s?trust me  once you get started  you will be so glad you did    Each and every one of these benefits  on its own  can increase your professional and personal success    Combined  they have the power to change your entire outlook and sense of satisfaction in the work you do every day     What speaks to you? Find it and try it!  There was a group of about seven teachers I knew who started a walking club that met three days a week after school    Their goals were to get exercise  lose weight  and laugh…each a powerful component of stress reduction    One teacher told me  “Those three days of walking with my friends are the only thing sometimes that keeps me off the evening news!” Although she was being humorous  looking forward to the time with colleagues to walk  talk  and laugh was truly a powerful support tool to get her through stressful days     That s one example  where a group of teachers found what worked for them  but there are many other activities proven to reduce stress    Yoga  exercise  art  meditation  journaling  volunteering  spending time in nature  finding opportunities for laughter  taking a long bath  or numerous other activities and hobbies can all help    What s important is to find what it is that speaks to you and that gives you enjoyment  and to get started     The key to beginning and sustaining your plan is to schedule activities just like you do with other appointments    It has to be scheduled in and we have to hold that chunk of time to the highest priority    Many educators struggle with feeling like it is selfish to take that time for themselves    Just as going to a doctor s appointment isn t selfish  neither should participation in activities to reduce stress and maintain a healthy body    These are essential    Once we are all able to change our perspective on the value and importance of “me time ” getting started and being consistent gets much easier     Many years when I was teaching  I would take a gym bag to school with me  with the understanding that I wouldn t leave the school in the afternoon without changing into my workout clothes    It was this intention that forced me to hold myself accountable    And  coincidentally  or perhaps not   the days that I was kicking and screaming inside because I didn t want to go were the exact times that I needed a workout the most    It s up to each of us  as individuals  to hold ourselves accountable and make sure the “me time” on the schedule is sacred    We must avoid excuses and ensure nothing interferes     “Draw the line” to establish a stress reduction plan  Once you ve thought about your unique stress reduction plan  it s time to activate it    Here are some steps I recommend  based on my own experience     Acknowledge the importance of your stress reduction plan?Think about how important it is to take control of stress reduction and think through the role it will play in your professional and personal lives    Consider all the benefits! Honestly address areas of your life that need improving?It may be getting rid of toxic relationships  improving your diet  finding time for more exercise  or rekindling a love for some hobbies that once gave you joy    Whatever it is  don t be afraid to take it on directly    Create a schedule that carves out and schedules “me time”…guilt free?Once you re clear on your direction  put it on the calendar and hold that time as your line in the sand    Know that when you consistently engage in your stress reduction activities  you are helping to create the best version of yourself    This enables you to be the leader that your students deserve and ensures that modeling selfcare will inspire others to follow suit    Whatever you decide  it should be about what speaks to you    But  as the research shows  and as you ve no doubt learned from your own experience in this stressful profession   it is important that we all take action    I m sending you my wishes for success stress reduction and my encouragement to get started!,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1    Humility You re probably very good at what you do–at least parts of it    You re also probably very bright  compassionate  and driven or you wouldn t have made it to whatever place you re currently in as an educator    But change requires selfawareness and a humble approach to your craft    Instructional strategies are great  but the ability to see yourself and the need for change–within or around you–is the most critical step in any process of growth and change    Be honest with yourself–your strengths and weaknesses    Your needs versus student needs    Reflecting on how that lesson or activity went  or why that assessment went the way it went    Content that s fun versus content that changes students    Admit when you were wrong  or when an idea you said was good turned out badly or viceversa    Honesty–coupled with humility–leads to growth    2    Vision Teachers who grow have the ability to see the ‘big picture –what s most important  the value of an idea or strategy  the drains on their own creative energy  etc    They ‘see  what s happening around them and learning and make adjustments and grow    As often as possible  strive for a balance of thinking  tools  strategies  and related resources    The most popular  clicked  shared  and curated content on the internet is probably lists    Top 10 Strategies For _____  25 Apps _____   8 Tips For _____  etc    This is probably because they re easy to skim  extract takeaways  save  and move on with your life    But to really see a change in your teaching  strive to have a balance of content—of thought leadership  tools  strategies  frameworks  and other resources that  in fragments  combine to make a fuller  clearer picture of the complexity of teaching and learning    Depending on your own expertise  experience  and comfort level  you may need more of one area and less of another and that s fine    But resist the temptation to skip anything longer than a few paragraphs and go straight for the pretty graphics  books  blog posts  and webinars with whizbang titles that promise you the world    Your time is valuable but because it is valuable  that s all the more reason to seek out the strategy to use with the app in the learning model that followed up on the thinking in the inspiring piece you read last week    Think of your needs as a kind of spectrum or hierarchy–or even a system of needs    And a crucial part of vision is what you see    A teacher who grows in capacity over time has the vision to see what s working and what s not–to separate what is and is not important  see #5  and have a clear sense of improvement and progress around the former while being able to navigate around the latter    3    Meaningful Collaboration It s all well and good that you ve found a great literacy framework or strategy  edtech tool  or framework for collaboration  but you re only one person    Share the knowledge—and with a diverse audience of folks you think will read it  value it  and share it themselves    Start a ripple    Share it in diverse ways    Print a copy and leave it on a colleague s chair    Send it through email    Share it on your own blog    Use Pinterest  twitter  or some other method of socializing the thinking    And don t just share with new teachers and friends  but your superintendent  state commissioner  neighboring principals  and perhaps most critically  parents—not just online  but people in your local community that you know and understand     4    A Sense of Belonging Consistently look to integrate the content you read—with committees  PD plans  professional learning communities  parents  curriculum  student work  etc    Don t just seek to “use” things  but rather to fuse them with other important pieces of the teaching and learning process    If you want to go fast  go alone    if you want to go far  go together    5    A Sense of Priority Be selective in what you read    A lot of titles and headlines promise thinking and utility that just isn t delivered in the content itself  whether it s a book  blog post  video  or other media    And some of it may be from reputable sources    Be selective    There is only so much information you can consistently use    Pare down the sources—anywhere from five to ten blogs or social channels should be more than enough to support your growth as an educator and allow for change    Just make sure TeachThought   com is on the list    6    Diverse Ideas & Perspectives You may tend towards content that justifies your own opinion—confirmation bias being what it is    And there s nothing wrong with that    The bulk of your content should likely reflect the tone and philosophy of your teaching and learning worldviews    But don t be afraid to challenge yourself by diversifying—confronting new possibilities with a critical eye and an open mind    This is how you grow    And as mentioned in item #1  Balance   diversify in terms of types of content as well    Curricula  curricula  frameworks  dialogic content and conversations  and so on    7    Pedagogical Knowledge Knowledge is everything–it spawns creativity  potential  and purpose    Knowledge about how your content area obviously is crucial  as is knowledge about how to actually teach  pedagogical knowledge     But also core to this is knowledge about how people learn–neurology  psychology  etc    8    Reflection And a big part of this is time–having the time  chronological  and mental space  psychological  to make it happen in an authentic and organic way    Take a moment and look at the work students complete  and the strategies you use to bring them to and prepare them for that work    Take a close look at how you interact with students  colleagues  and parents    Scrutinize your curriculum  assessments  and assessment results    student engagement  and the tone of the conversations they have that you don t lead    Look closely  think carefully  and see if you can trace back anything  from macro perspective to a very micro strategy  to something you read  watched  or observed    The vast majority of the time you may not be successful here  but try    Where did this lesson come from? The perspective that led me to trash this unit or rethink this other unit completely? What helped me see this way of looking at mobile learning? And the potential in this assessment form?  There are many ways to measure understanding     Where did all this change come from  and where can I get more? When am I at my best? What do I need to grow?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
ay you ve got some students    Two or 122    Doesn t matter–they re there    What should you do with them? Oh  lots    There s lots to consider     First  you have to see them    Really see them for who they are  where they are    Not as test results  pending adults  nor as vessels for filling  or humanoids to push towards some goal they may not understand in either theory or application    You can t see them in terms of gender  grade level  intelligence  compliance–you have to see that student    Who ‘are  they? Where are they ‘from ? What do they think about themselves? About other people? About their own potential and their future? What motivates them? What do they–more than anything else–want?  Then you accept them    Accept everything without judgment because it has nothing to do with you  and probably less to do with them that you d think    In your mind you now  to whatever level you are able considering all of your responsibilities as a teacher  have at least started to both see a child as they really are  and then have moved to accept all of that    The child and their story–everything that brought them to you in this place during this time in their life    You can pick and choose what to focus on with that child–what to teach them    That part comes later    For now  you simply really see and truly accept     Next  you protect them    From bad policy    From bullies    From themselves    From bad assignments and useless academic standards and their own insecurities    That doesn t mean you don t let them fail    You do    But part of helping a student fail is protecting them from the kinds of delusions–again  about themselves and what they expect out of the world and people around them    If they feel seen and accepted and protected  they can begin to do their best thinking     So you challenge them    That student and that level–what sort of challenge do they need? What suits them best? Is it against other students? A high score? Something creative? Something emotional? Musical? Personal? Academic? Shortterm? Longterm? Public? Private?  With this kind of opportunity  you give them an opportunity to surprise themselves    Achievements should be varied and fresh and new    Something they haven t done before  or a level of performance that haven t achieved–and that they can see the value in    Remember  if you know that child in that place  then you have an idea of what they might see value in    You ve set them up to achieve something–and here you are  beside them     Then help them see and prioritize opportunities    Could be problems to solve    An opportunity for artistic expression    Inspiration    Collaboration with someone from another country    A chance to demonstrate empathy  curiosity  affection  or citizenship    You can start by pointing these opportunities out so they know what they re looking for  and then help them spot them for themselves    When they can readily identify opportunities that matter to them–that child in that place–then they can prioritize them    They see their own time and creativity and ingenuity and attention as something value  which means it can be put to good use  or wasted    Like any other crucial resource  their attention matters–and is finite     Part of this is a mattering of the ability to ask the right question at the right time  so model curiosity for that student    This is what it looks like to wonder    To not be sure–to pause and consider in a situation what is and is not known  and responding accordingly based on context    Here and now  this is what s happening  this is what s possible  and this is how I choose to respond    Heavy stuff for anyone  much less a child     At this point  accepted  protected  challenged  and aware  you can begin to agitate their thinking    This is part of challenging them  but it s a bit more personal and creative and absolutely intellectual    Defy their expectations    Force them to confront ideas that challenge what they think they know    Divergent perspectives    Careful now    No need to shake them off their foundations    Just move the ground around a little so that they can see that it moves     After that–and you ve done a lot–finally help them to see themselves    Who they are and where they are–remember  this is where you started yourself    This is less about image and more about membership and legacy and community and identity    This will help them see their own interdependence      I am a person     I am a member of this family and this community     I am connected to these people and this history and these legacies and these problems and these opportunities      Therefore  I need to have these skills and understand these ideas so that I can respond  moment by moment  day by day  as I make a life      Do these kinds of things–and so many others–with your students    These create authentic needs to know for all of the academic content you ll teach them    But more crucially  you can be sure you re not simply teaching content  or even ideas  but people,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Helping Students Do Their Best    20 Strategies To Get The Best Work From Your Students 1    Give them authentic voice & choice And a big part of this is leaving ‘room for interpretation  in the assignment    Those gray areas can confuse students unaccustomed to agency and choice  but once they become comfortable with it  it can be a significant factor in helping them show what their ‘best  actually is    At the end of the day  students can t become ‘great  by duplicating your thinking and fulfilling your sense of priority    It has to not just involve them  but depend ontheir own genius and effort    In Teaching Disruptively  I said    “Teaching disruptively  then  has nothing to do with you    You ll know it when you ve found it because it won t suggest ‘disruption  at all    Instead  you ll see the rising of a kind of slow ash—of new ideas that aren t always packaged how you asked  and don t always do what you want them to do   ” Which makes helping students believe in themselves a big first step–and the students who need that kind of bolstering may not be the ones you suspect    Some students who ‘struggle  do so extrinsically–meaning that their belief in themselves is strong but their belief in the outward circumstance  like your classroom or a specific assignment within in it  may not be    Further  like adults  a child s confidence can appear strong but be either fragile or contextual–highlydependent on a narrow set of circumstances that can disappear quickly    And take that ‘confidence  with them    2    Help them see To get the best work from students  help them see    See what they re doing and why    See what others have done and how    See what s possible    Help them to see what s possible in the assignment  how the work can benefit them  and most crucially that they re capable of doing that important work and that you re there for them when they waver    2    Help them create their own standards for quality They won t naturally know how to do this Rubrics and scoring guides can help here as well    3    Start and end with their genius and gifts    And this includes the gifts and resources from their family—baking if they own a bakery  construction if they work in construction… 4    Revisit ‘old  work Keep a portfolio of their best work–physical or digital or both    Public and social or private and just between you and them–then use these bits and pieces to identify gaps  find inspiration  pivot for new applications  or simply improve in terms of quality  accuracy  etc    5    Let them see expert models If they re building a bridge  to get the best from them help them see expert bridgebuilding    If they re going to sing or paint or write or act or excavate or farm or direct  let them see what the most passionate  driven  and skilled people in those fields do    Then help them do it  too    6    Give them personalized feedback Personalized feedback means the right feedback  see #7 below  at the right time  this one can be tricky  in the format  tone  and duration that works for that student    Whether they re taking a test  finishing a project  or doing something entirely outofthebox  the more precise  welltimed  and thoughtful the learning feedback  the better chance they have to do their best work    GIving learning feedback is easy  but giving learning feedback that actually improves student work is another thing entirely    7    Teach diagnostically Think causeeffect… When they don t understand the assignment  cause   they don t ask the right questions about the assignment that will help them  effect     When they have too much work in other classes  cause   they rush their work  are prone to errors  and don t show much vision or creativity in what they do  effect     So you have to think in terms of causes and effect–sometimes through a kind of diagnostic teaching    Is it confidence? Is it a skill? Is it a knowledge gap? Temporary apathy? Just too early in the morning for that kind of thinking? A big part of this is being able to  as a teacher  separate skills  competencies  and knowledge necessary to complete highquality work on an assignmentbyassignment basis    Obviously  the background knowledge and skills need to be there in order for certain ‘things  to be done    If they can t use idea organization strategies  writing compelling essays is going to be difficult    If the essay isn t ‘their best   you have to figure out why it s not their best–and not all students    That student standing in front of you    The answer is usually framed as a class  e   g     ‘They struggle using transitional phrases  when in reality  though that might be true  there are either bigger problems–or other problems further upstream  like not fully understanding the point of the essay  that make their lack of transitional phrases in their essay an effect rather than a cause    That is  they don t fully understand what they re writing about and why  so they struggle to create a compelling argument in writing  which means they don t use transitional words and phrases as naturally     Seeing this  you go back and give them a minilesson on transitions because that s what they re missing    And while you re not wrong  you re missing why *they* are ‘wrong  and so will be less likely to help them    And you ll be less likely to see improvement in student learning as a result    8    Clarify and emphasize the purpose If they don t know exactly what they re doing and why  it s hard for them to care–and if they don t care  you can forget about getting their best work    9    Use rubric designed for quality  not ‘scoring  First  know the difference between a scoring guide and a rubric–then design a rubric that actually supports students in learning more and doing their best work in your classroom    10    Let them see models from other students While work from experts is useful in one way  work from peers can often have more credibility with some students    There are many reasons for this  from confidence and competitiveness to audience and selfefficacy    Just know that parents motivate students one way  their peers another  teachers another  and so on    We all have different things that move us for different reasons  and students are no different    10    Get the school out of it The more something ‘smells like school   the less likely it is to get the very best genius from a student    That doesn t mean it s impossible  but students–especially by late middle school into high school and college–think of school differently than teachers and parents do    The more personal and authentic their reason for learning  the better the chance you ll see the very best performance from that student    11    And get it out of the school Whether you re ‘publishing in the real world   using placebased education through projectbased learning  connecting a high school student with a university  a middle school student with a content area expert  or any other reason  the more likely the work has a legitimate reason to ‘leave the school   the more motivated many students can be to give their best    12    Spiral the big  important ideas in your curriculum In 5 Simple Ideas That Can Transform Your Teaching  I said to ‘constantly spiral the most important  most transferable big ideas in your content     This is partly because those ‘big ideas –assuming they re sufficiently big–take a while to grasp and require a variety of different learning approaches to master    But these same big ideas are  ideally  actually useful to for students to know and be able to ‘do  in the execution of work that is inspiring  authentic  published  and connected to other things they care about    13    Break big stuff into little stuff    Take one of those big ideas and break it down into smaller ideas  this is often part of ‘unpacking standards      The less overwhelming the work is–and the more frequently students can work on these smaller bits that often end up as part of the fundamentals of the big ideas–the more likely the students will learn more  then actually use what they learned    14    Start with emotion    And end there  too      See below     15    Make curiosity  joy  and passion consistent ‘currencies  in your classroom Give them points for joy and passion    Don t like that approach? Model it    Praise it    Help students praise it when they see it in one another    16    When possible  make ‘design /design thinking an integral part of the assignment …or at least make elements of design thinking impact critical parts of that assignment    You ll know this is working when you see the same assignment produce very different results from different students    17     Use metacognition before  during  and after important assignments What are you thinking about this assignment? How did that thought make you feel? What did it remind you of? When do you do your best kind of thinking in these situations? Now that you ve turned your assignment it  in hindsight when were you ate your best and why? 18    Help them care–get the attention of your students and don t let it go Want better work from students? Get their attention and keep it    Make it fun    Add music or video games    Go outside    Make it ‘controversial  somehow    Go outside    Note  this can backfire and distract from the whole point of the assignment–use it intentionally and thoughtfully    Use the ‘fun  as a backdrop for the experience  not the other way around    19    Design the learning to last Whether through 40/40/40    PBL  placebased education  etc     design work for students that will last–something they ll want to keep for years  that will function in their family or community for years  that s worth curating in a portfolio for college  etc    Honor them by giving them work that matters    20    Change the grade if the quality of the work changes To get the best work from students  be willing to regrade work at any time while doing your best to  insofar as you are able  to get the ‘grading  out of the assignment     Or at least be willing to add points for specific improvements  or let them revise and reflect on their impact of those revisions and give points for that if you re pressed for time,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Challenge Of Outcomes & StandardsBased Assessment First a preface    itemizing ways to measure understanding is functionally different than students choosing a way to demonstrate what they know—mainly because in a backwarddesign approach where the learning target is identified first  that learning target dictates everything else downstream    If  for example  a student was given a topic and an audience and were allowed to ‘do  something and then asked to create something that demonstrated what they learned  the result would be wildly different across students    Put another way  students would learn different things in different ways    By dictating exactly what every student will ‘understand  ahead of time  certain assessment forms become ideal    It also becomes much more likely that students will fail    If students can learn anything  then they only fail if they fail to learn anything at all or fail to demonstrate learning anything at all    By deciding exactly what a student will learn and exactly how they will show you they learned it  three outcomes  among others  are possible    1    The student learned a lot but not what you wanted them to learn 2    The student learned exactly what you wanted them to learn but failed to demonstrate it in the assessment 3    The student failed to learn But what if we d been misled? For an analogy  consider a car    If we want the car running at its best—to be safe to operate  to start when we want to go somewhere  to attain the fuel efficiency that we want  to look and smell the way we want  etc     we need data about those conditions    The look and smell are easy enough  and the fuel efficiency is a matter of math    The reliability is a little more abstract—cut and dry but the product of many other maintenance factors and so requires more abstraction to predict    And the safety bit? Equally abstract—and subjective  to boot    Imagine being concerned about the reliability of the car  as anyone would be   so you developed tests that could be used to predict the future likelihood that the car would start     It s at this point that I m realizing I could ve chosen a much better analogy  but I m sticking with the car/starting thing    Sorry     So imagine giving a bunch of tests to predict today whether the car would start tomorrow    It makes sense on paper because we want to monitor that idea  but it seems a little wasteful  right? And it gets wasteful fast when you consider the possibility that the car may fail test after test after test and still continue to start    This means that the tests we developed to predict whether or not the car would start likely measured something but not what we wanted them to measure    The tests were bad and the data misleading and any conclusions drawn accordingly invalid    In an outcomesbased and datadriven circumstance  the data and the decisions made using that data are everything    If that data is misleading  it s not hard to realize that we will be misled–as teachers and learners–too    First  Determine The Purpose Of The Assessment If all students are all going to have their height and weight measured  a common standard makes sense    If students are all going to have their attractiveness measured  any kind of ‘standard  is creepy    Measuring knowledge and mastery of competencies and skills isn t quite as subjective as ‘beauty   but isn t anywhere close to as cut and dry as height and weight    We can give the same test that measures the same thing in the same way for all students and do no damage really—provided we are all on the same page that we re not measuring understanding but rather measuring performance on a test    In a perfect world  we d have countless ways to measure that understanding—all valid  universally understood  engaging to students  etc    In pursuit  I thought it d make sense to brainstorm different ways to measure understanding    Some will be more or less useful depending on content areas  grade levels  student motivation  etc     not to mention what the purpose of the assessment is    Do you need a snapshot? Do you need to measure mastery or growth? Do you want it to be flexible for a variety of learners or more binary—you either pass or you fail? Do you want students to be able to return to the assessment periodically or is this a oneshot kind of deal? Is the assessment for the teacher or the student? If you re not clear about why you re assessing  and what you re going to do with the data the assessment provides  you re wasting a lot of time  energy  and resources–your own and that of the students    With that mind  see below for 50 ways to measure understanding    Some are assessment forms  e   g     exit slips   some are models  e   g     Bloom s Taxonomy  and some are more frequently thought of as teaching strategies  e   g     Socratic Discussion     50 Ways To Measure Understanding Assessment Forms For Measuring Understanding These can be thought of as reasons to test In 6 Types Of Assessment  we offered up exactly that–six ‘kinds  of tests that imply the purpose of and standard for the assessment    1    NormReferenced Assessments Normreferenced assessments are assessments used to compare students to one another rather    2    CriterionBased Assessments A criterionbased assessment assesses a student s performance against a clear and published goal or objective    This is in contrast  for example  to a test which students hope to ‘do well on  but without a clear and concise objective and/or without clear performance standards for that objective    3    Standardized Assessments A standardized assessment is any assessment containing elements that are the same for all students universally    The perceived benefit is that standardization ensures all students are being weighed equally and that there is a common ‘bar  for students to be measured with    4    StandardsBased Assessment A form of standardized assessment  a standardsbased assessment is one that is based on an academic content standard  e   g     ‘Determining an author s purpose               5    Personalized assessments While these aren t necessarily ‘different  kinds of assessments  they do reflect different reasons to assess    6    PreAssessment Preassessment is any kind of evaluation  analysis  or measurement of student understanding that occurs before the teaching/learning process begins    The purpose of preassessment varies–it can be to help plan lessons and activities  revise curriculum maps  create personalized learning pathways for individual students  help inform grouping strategies  plan future assessments  etc    7    Formative Assessment Formative assessment generally occurs during the teaching and learning  though it s not that simple and a better way to think about formative assessment is to consider that it provides data to form and inform the teaching and learning on an ongoing basis    A common example of a formative assessment is a quiz    Types of quizzes? Pop quizzes  planned/scheduled quizzes  timed quizzes  and so on    This can also be thought of as ‘diagnostic assessment   and is ideally the most common form of assessment in K12 learning environments  because the purpose is to measure understanding to better create future learning experiences     8    Summative Assessment  A summative assessment is any assessment done when the ‘teaching is done     This makes the process of ‘summative assessment  a curious thing unless there are no more opportunities to teach and learn  like the end of a school year     9    Timed Assessment This one is selfexplanatory–any assessment that is timebound is a timed assessment  though technically that timing can be minutes or even years depending on the nature and purpose and scale of the assessment    Timed Assessments can also be combined with other forms–a timed project or timed essay  for example    The idea is the constraint of time somehow shapes the scope of the test and the performance of the student    11    Untimed Assessment Untimed assessments are less common than timed assessments if for no other reason than the schedulednature of modern education necessitates it    12    OpenEnded Assessment In contrast to a timed  standardsbased and standardized assessment  an openended assessment is generally designed to provide a proving ground for the students to demonstrate knowledge  skills  and competencies    Through openended assessment  student autonomy  creativity  and selfefficacy play a larger role in their performance    Due to the nature of this approach  the mindset of the learner is crucial    Without confidence  ownership  and a clear sense of how and what they might demonstrate what they know  learners can feel uncertain–and worse  may fail to ‘show what they know  and misinform future planning of learning experiences because of this ‘failure    A learning blend is an example of an openended assessment    13    GameBased Assessment A gamebased assessment is often technologybased  e   g     video games   but an athletic contest can be considered gamebased assessments as it s the performance within a given set of rules that determines what the learner knows and can ‘do     14    Benchmark Assessment Benchmark assessments evaluate student performance at periodic intervals  frequently at the end of a grading period    Can predict student performance on endoftheyear summative assessments    15    Group Assessment Group assessment is what it sounds like it might be–assessment done in a group with  at times  varying roles and responsibilities    Obviously  a design challenge is Group Assessment is to know exactly what you re assessing as social dynamics and individual roles and responsibilities can obscure the analysis of student learning    Different Assessment Forms For Measuring Understanding These can be thought of as ‘types of tests  16    Short Responses Tests Example    Short  written or verbal responses to questions or prompts 17    Extended Responses  OnDemand  Essays  etc     Example    Like the above but longer–anywhere from a few paragraphs to entire research essays 18    MultipleChoice Tests Not sure this needs explaining–multiplechoice assessments are great for providing data but are highly dependent on the quality of the questions and responses–and even then favor highlyliterate and motivated students over others    19    TrueFalse Tests If you re good at creating very nuanced True/False assessment items  they can challenge students with a strong grasp of content by forcing them to closely consider whether something is ‘true  or not    True/False assessments can also be useful for struggling or ‘hesitant  students because the barrier to answering is so low  like a multiplechoice assessment  but there are only two ‘answers  to choose between    Tip    You can allow students to revise the true or false statement until it seems true to them based on what they know    The changes they make can go a long way in helping to diagnose what they re misunderstanding    20    Matching Items The strength of matching items is that they re simple to create  complete  and score–and welldesigned  can be surprisingly effective in uncovering what students know    The challenge with these kinds of assessments is that they do very little to demonstrate depth of understanding and are only useful with certain kinds of content    21    Performance & Demonstration  i   e     watching the student attempt to demonstrate understanding/competency/skill in realtime  Example    Watching a student try to hit a free throw in basketball or make a specific pass in soccer  etc    It doesn t have to be athleticbased  however    Students can also demonstrate the effect of gravity on planetary orbits or how propaganda works  etc    22    A Visual Representation Example    Students can create a visual representation of the water cycle–how it works  all the forms it takes  its benefits  the physics of the process  etc    What is visualized is obviously part of the assessment    They could also create one for the use of transitional phrases in writing–what they do  when they re used  what their effects are  etc    23    Analogies Analogies are underrated assessment tools    students can ‘answer  analogies you create  modify them to create new meanings  explain why an analogy you create is wrong  or create their own analogies to demonstrate understanding    Example    If you wanted to assess a student s understanding of thesis statements  you could have them ‘answer  an analogy you create by completing the analogy    Thesis Statement    Essay       Company   ________  mission or slogan  24    Concept Maps 25    Graphic Organizers  like analogies  these are also very underrated ways to measure understanding  26    A Physical Artifact 27    A Question  i   e     a student asking/revising a question as a form of assessment  28    A Debate 29    A Conversation/Group Discussion/Socratic Discussion 30    Question Stems See here for examples of question stems for critical thinking    You can also let students create their own stems and quiz/test one another    31    RolePlaying  e   g     roleplaying historical figures to assess biographical knowledge–this is similar to #21  32    QFT Session 33    Observable Metacognition This nontraditional assessment form is asking to  somehow ‘watching  the student think about their own thinking an using it to ‘measure  understanding 34    SelfAssessment  where the student evaluates their own understanding with or without the help of the teacher  35    PeerAssessment 36    Expert Assessment This one is obviously better suited to more skilled and knowledgeable learners  in high school and college  for example     An example of Expert Assessment is a talent show like American Idol Any kind panel evaluation  where a third party chooses one or more of the above forms  that seeks to to evaluate and measure understanding where the assessment and feedback depends on the specific and often narrow expertise of the panel itself is an ‘expert assessment     37    RAFT Assignments RAFT is a common ELA activity that stands for Role Audience Format Topic  or Theme/Thesis/Tone     I hesitated to put this on the list because it s bestsuited to EnglishLanguage Arts/Literature/Writing/Literacy and is hard to explain it s utility as an assessment tool even in that narrow domain    The idea here is to alter elements of an activity or assignment to force students to think critically to complete it  and it doesn t have to be ‘RAFT –you can frame anything in any number of ways     If you ve never used RAFT before  you re probably best off skipping this one until you re more familiar with it    Email me if you have any questions     Example    Students studying the Declaration of Independence can revise it for a specific audience or communicate the same ideas in a different format or tone  rather than the letter/political tone of the original     38    A Challenge Creating a challenge for students to complete in order to demonstrate understanding is another nontraditional form of assessment but can be useful to engage hesitant learners or bring out the best in gifted students    Gamification is useful in challengebased assessment    39    TeacherDesigned Projects Create a project that produces a ‘thing  whose quality will or will not demonstrate student understanding    40    StudentDesigned Projects The same as above but the student designs the project  likely with the teacher     This will confuse a lot of students–you ll know fast if this is going to be useful for your purpose for assessment or not    41    SelfDirected Learning By supporting the student to reflect on  prioritize  plan  and complete their own learning experiences on their own  students will inherently have their understanding measured    SelfDirected Learning is a form of openended assessment–you can see one of the selfdirected learning models I created here    Frameworks & Assessment Models For Measuring Understanding These can be thought of as ways to frame the thinking about the content being assessed in the test 42    Bloom s Taxonomy 43    The TeachThought Learning Taxonomy 44    UbD s 6 Facets Of Understanding 45    Marzano s New Taxonomy 46    Assessing ‘Transferability  It is common for assessments to be standardized  universal  and practiced in those standardized and universal forms  for example  a multiple choice assessment with a set number of items and a standardized amount of time to complete     This is great for normreferencing  but a terrible way to truly measure what a student understands–and the strength and depth of that understanding    That s where transfer of understanding comes in    You can read more about different kinds of learning transfer    47    A Graded Assessment This is the most common form of formal assessment–one that is scored  feedback is given  and data is shared  even if only via a letter grade     48    An Ungraded Assessment This is less common than graded assessments–which is strange because the most useful purpose of assessment is to provide data to revise planned instruction    Feedback is also useful  but the scoring  grading  and communication of a grade can take time  distract learners emotionally  and most critically obscure data about that understanding    That s not to say that assessments should never be graded  but scoring  documenting a score  then communicating that score to students  parents  colleges  etc     significantly alters the tone  scale  and reach of that assessment    It becomes more like a public performance than a way to measure understanding    49    FeedbackOnly Assessment Learning Feedbackonly Assessment is similar to ungraded but focused intently on providing detailed feedback to individual learners to help them mastery the standard  competency  or skill    50    Pass/Fail Assessment While feedback can be given  time limits can be imposed  and various taxonomies can be used  the primary characteristic of passfail assessment is that letter grades and points are generally not given and the standard for performance is binary–that is  the standard either was or was not met    An athlete trying to vault over a 6meter bar is participating in a kind of ‘pass/fail  assessment in that they either will or will not clear the bar    51    Ongoing ‘Climate of Assessment  A ‘Climate of Assessment  is a personal favorite of mine    In this approach  critical and complex ideas and skills are constantly revisited and iterated upon in various ways  forms  and contexts while supplemented by less complex/quickertomaster content    Assessment is frequent  playful  clear  compelling  and always formative    52    Snapshot of Assessment This is an assessment of what the student seems to know at that moment based on that given assessment form    These can be misleading but useful if they re preceded and proceeded by additional snapshots in the aforementioned ‘climate of assessment     53    A Measurement Of Growth Over Time In this kind of assessment  mastery isn t measured–nor are students compared to one another  as they are in normreferenced assessments     Instead  the focus is on far the student has  or has not  ‘come     One strategy here is grading backward     This approach  while complex  is naturally differentiated for each student  has a positive tone  and makes it much more difficult to ‘fail  unless the student actually literally atrophies in terms of skills and understanding    54    Concept Mastery This kind of assessment is mainly distinguished by what s being assessed–the focus here being a grasp of concepts and ideas rather than skills and competencies  like the item below     55    Competency & Skill Mastery Many academic standards combine concepts and skills–which is fine because that s often what the ‘real world  is like    But when you re trying to troubleshoot student achievement and evaluate what they actually  truly understand  versus how they did on the test   being able to separate what they ‘know  and what they can ‘do  can make remediation more efficient–and make the student feel better about their own ‘lack of mastery  because they are able to see what they do and don t know  what they can and cannot do  etc     which is more precise and comforting than ‘I missed the question  or ‘I failed the test,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oneonone tutoring is perhaps the ideal form of teaching    all of a teacher   s attention can be focused on one student  and they can completely customise their teaching for that person and tailor individual feedback and corrections based on a twoway dialogue with them    In realistic settings  however  one teacher must usually teach several  tens  or even hundreds of students at once    How can teachers possibly hope to clear up many learners    different misconceptions in these larger settings in a reasonable time?The best method developed so far for largerscale classrooms is called peer instruction    Originally created by Eric Mazur at Harvard  8   it has been studied extensively in a wide variety of contexts  including programming  9  10     In simplified form  peer instruction proceeds in several phases   1    The instructor gives learners a brief introduction to the topic   2    The instructor then gives learners a multiple choice question that probes for misconceptions rather than simple factual recall     A programming example is given in Code 1 that relates to integer comparison and loops     The multiple choice question must be well designed    There is no point asking a trivial question that all students will get right or one with meaningless wrong answers that no student will pick    The ideal questions are those for which 40%–60% of students are likely to get the right answer the first time   11   p    23  and those in which every wrong answer corresponds to a misconception that will cause it to be picked by at least some students   3    Learners then vote on the answer to the question individually  thus formalising their initial prediction   4    Next  learners are given several minutes to discuss those answers with one another in small groups  typically 2–4 students   and they then reconvene and vote again   5    Then  the instructor can act on the latest answers    If all the learners have the right answer  the instructor can move on    If some of the wrong answers remain popular after group discussion  the instructor can address those specific misconceptions directly or engage in classwide discussion   Peer instruction is essentially a way to provide onetoone mentorship in a scalable way    Group discussion significantly improves learners    understanding because it forces them to clarify their thinking  which can be enough to call out gaps in reasoning    Repolling the class then lets the instructor know if they can move on or if further explanation is necessary    While it significantly outperforms lecturebased instruction in most situations  it can be problematic if ability levels differ widely  as they often do in introductory programming classes because of varied prior experience     Pair programming  Tip 5  can be used to mitigate this,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Rather than using slides  instructors should create programs in front of their learners  12     This is more effective for multiple reasons   1    It enables instructors to be more responsive to   what if?   questions    While a slide deck is like a highway  live coding allows instructors to go offroad and follow their learners    interests or answer unanticipated questions   2    It facilitates unintended knowledge transfer    students learn more than the instructor consciously intends to teach by watching how instructors do things    The extra knowledge may be high level  e   g     whether a program is written topdown or bottomup  or fairly low level  e   g     learning useful editor shortcuts    3    It slows the instructor down    if the instructor has to type in the program as they go along  they can only go twice as fast as their learners  rather than 10fold faster as they could with slides—which risks leaving everyone behind   4    Learners get to see how instructors diagnose and correct mistakes    Novices are going to spend most of their time doing this  but it   s left out of most textbooks   5    Watching instructors make mistakes shows learners that it   s alright to make mistakes of their own  13     Most people model the behaviour of their teachers    if the instructor isn   t embarrassed about making and talking about mistakes  learners will be more comfortable doing so too   Live coding does have some drawbacks  but with practice  these can be avoided or worked around   1    Instructors can go too slowly  either because they are not good typists or by spending too much time looking at notes to try to remember what they meant to type   2    Instructors can spend too much time typing in boilerplate code that is needed by the lesson but not directly relevant to it  such as library import statements     Not only does this slow things down  it can distract learners from the intended thrust of a lesson    As Willingham  14  says    Memory is the residue of thought      if the instructor spends their time typing boilerplate  that may be all that learners take away    This can be avoided by starting with a partial skeleton that includes the boilerplate or having it on hand to copy and paste when needed     Of the two  we prefer the former  since learners may not be able to keep up with copying and pasting    Note that live coding does not always have to start with a blank screen    instructors may give students some starter code that relies solely on concepts they have already mastered and then extend it or modify it with live coding    Instructors who use live coding should ensure that learners have reference material available after lectures  such as a textbook  but should also recognize that students of all ages increasingly turn to question and answer sites such as Stack Overflow for information,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
When instructors are using live coding  they usually run the program several times during its development to show what it does    Surprising research from peer instruction in physics education shows that learners who observe a demonstration do not learn better than those who did not see the demonstration  15   and in fact  many learners misremember the outcome of demonstrations afterwards  16     In other words  demonstrations can actually be useless or actively harmful   The key to making demonstrations more effective is to make learners predict the outcome of the demonstration before performing it    Crucially  their prediction should be in some way recorded or public  e   g     by a show of hands  by holding up cue cards marked with A  B  C  or D  or by talking to their neighbour    We speculate that the sting of being publicly wrong leads learners to pay more attention and to reflect on what they are learning    regardless of whether this hypothesis is true  instructors should be careful not to punish or criticise students who predicted wrongly but rather to use those incorrect predictions as a spur to further exploration and explanation,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pair programming is a software development practice in which 2 programmers share 1 computer    One person  called the driver  does the typing  while the other  called the navigator  offers comments and suggestions    The two switch roles several times per hour    Pair programming is a good practice in reallife programming  17  and also a good way to teach  18     Partners can not only help each other out during practical exercises but can also clarify each other   s misconceptions when the solution is presented   Both parties involved in pair programming learn while doing it    The weaker gets individual instruction from the stronger  while the stronger learns by explaining and by being forced to reconsider things that they may not have thought about in a while    When pair programming is used  it is important to put everyone in pairs  not just the learners who may be struggling  so that no one feels singled out    It   s also important to have people switch roles within each pair 3 or 4 times per hour so that the stronger personality in each pair does not dominate the session,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A principle that applies across all areas of education is that transference only comes with mastery  22     Courses should therefore stick to one language until learners have progressed far enough with it to be able to distinguish the forest from the trees    While an experienced programmer can  for example  take what they know about loops and function calls in one language and reuse that understanding in a language with a different syntax or semantics  a newcomer does not yet know which elements of their knowledge are central and which are accidental    Attempting to force transference too early—e   g     requiring them to switch from Python to JavaScript in order to do a web programming course early in their education—will confuse learners and erode their confidence,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Guzdial et al    found that having learners manipulate images  audio  and video in their early programming assignments increased retention in 2 senses    learners remembered more of the material when retested after a delay and were more likely to stay in computing programs  23     This is a particular instance of a larger observation    learners find authentic tasks more engaging than abstracted examples   A classic question in computing  and mathematics  education is whether problems are better with context  e   g     find the highest student grade  or without  e   g     find the maximum of a list of numbers     Bouvier et al     24  examined this with a multiuniversity study and found no difference between the two    They suggest that since it makes no difference  other considerations  such as motivation  should be given priority   One caution about choosing context is that context can inadvertently exclude some people while drawing others in    For example  many educators use computer games as a motivating example for programming classes  but some learners may associate them with violence and racial or gender stereotypes or simply find them unenjoyable    Whatever examples are chosen  the goal must be to move learners as quickly as possible from   hard and boring   to   easy and exciting    25    To help students accomplish a visible and satisfying result quickly  instructors can provide some prewritten software libraries or source code that starts students closer to the end goal    The idea that students must start from scratch and write all the code they need themselves is the relic of a bygone era of home microcomputers  and it was not true even then     Pick the task that you actually want to the students to engage in and provide everything else premade,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our final tip for teaching programming is that you don   t have to program to do it    Faced with the challenges of learning syntax  semantics  algorithms  and design  examples that seem small to instructors can still easily overwhelm novices    Breaking the problem down into smaller singleconcept pieces can reduce the cognitive load to something manageable   For example  a growing number of educators are including Parsons Problems in their pedagogic repertoire  20  27     Rather than writing programs from scratch  learners are given the lines of code they need to solve a problem  but in jumbled order    Reordering them to solve the problem correctly allows them to concentrate on mastering control flow without having to devote mental energy to recalling syntax or the specifics of library functions    They are also liked by learners    Ericson et al     28  found that learners were more likely to attempt Parsons Problems than nearby multiple choice questions in an ebook,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Elearning techniques using augmented and virtual realityThe booming developments in the technology of virtual reality  VR  and augmented reality  AR  can provide the field of information security training with new insights  innovative solutions  and handson experience    The main advantages of integration of such technologies in a training process are     i  faster learning due to efficiency of skill transfer     ii  realtime knowledge acquisition and assessment     iii  safety of practice     iv  greater engagement due to the use of outofclass learning environment    and  v  the possibility to have a handson training   What is VR and AR?VR is a computergenerated simulation of a reallife environment that  by means of stimulating vision and hearing  makes the user feel like experiencing the simulated reality firsthand    AR technologies provide their users with a view of a physical  realworld environment whose elements are augmented by computer input  such as video  graphics  or sound    Google Glass  an optical headmounted display having the form of a pair of eyeglasses  is a typical example of AR technology   Being similar  VR and AR differ in the sense that VR digitally recreates the reallife setting  whereas AR uses digital elements as an overlay to the real world    VR and AR should not be confused with Immersion    While Immersion allows the user to observe virtual environment by receiving artificial sensory stimuli merely  VR and AR not only allows the user to be a passive observer but also provides him/her with the opportunity to perform tasks in a virtual environment    It should be pointed out that VR and AR may have health effects on trainees  such as faintness and VR sickness  also known as cybersickness     Therefore  organizations willing to implement VR and AR in their training applications need to consult a medical doctor before doing so   The benefitsWe will briefly overview how AR and VR technologies can be used in information security training through discussing the three main advantages of such methods  namely   i  experiencing virtual consequences   ii  a possibility for gamification  and  iii  a high level of engagement   Virtual consequencesOne of the main benefits of AR and VR technologies is that trainees can experience the virtual consequences of their mistakes    To illustrate  if a trainee is unable to identify a virtual attachment containing ransomware  the trainee can observe the virtual consequences of the ransomware  such as encrypting files and showing a message requesting a ransom to be paid in cryptocurrency    In the context of information security training  such technologies can be used to provide instructions to trainees during incident simulations    For instance  AR and VR can provide a CEO who undertakes information security training with directions on how to instruct each member of the company on the steps aiming to reduce the impact of a cyberattack    Since AR and VR technologies can recognize objects  such technologies can be used to teach trainees on how to identify security loopholes in a reallife environment  like weak passwords  publication of information which can be used for conducting cyberattacks  phishing emails  lack of antivirus software  malicious websites   GamificationAR and VR technologies can also be used for gamification of information security training    Gamebased elearning brings numerous benefits  such as challenging  motivating  and engaging audience  and exploring the consequences in a safe virtual environment    For instance  the trainees of an exemplary game can be divided into two teams  namely  attackers and defenders    The attackers can receive points for identifying information security vulnerabilities  luring the victims to open malicious attachments  and conducting successful cyberattacks    The defenders can receive points for identifying cyber threats  implementing appropriate information security strategies  reporting cybersecurity incidents  and complying with security policies    Thus  while obtaining points and virtual badges  the two teams will acquire practical information security skills in an emotionally engaging way    It is worth mentioning that emotional engagement stimulates trainees to do more than normally expected   EngagementTraining programs implemented through AR and VR technology require the participants to take part in the training process actively    Such participation results in a higher level of engagement in the exercise and also bypasses the traditional “classroom” approach that often is found to be less impressive by participants   Due to their capacity for such emotional engagement  AR and VRbased training materials aiming to raise cyber security awareness amongst various people  especially kids  can be particularly advantageous    By way of illustration  such materials can raise awareness and instruct how to behave in a case of cyberbullying  how to browse safely on the Internet while avoiding the risks of malware  and how to avoid providing sensitive personal information to strangers or allegedly legitimate institutions

Algorithms are everywhere    They help us travel efficiently  retrieve information from huge data sets  secure money transactions  recommend movies  books  videos  predict stock market etc    It is very tough to think about a daily task that does not benefit from efficient algorithms    Often the algorithms behind most of these tasks are very simple  yet their impact is tremendous    When I say “simple”  they are simple to people who know them    Most common people consider algorithms too mathematical    They assume that it is beyond their capability to understand algorithms    What they do not realize is that algorithms are often simple extensions of our daily rational thinking process   For example  almost everybody considers it stupid to buy an item for $24 and pay $6 shipping  if there is free shipping for orders of more than $25    If you add one more item of cost $1  you saved $5    Also  when we pack our bags for travel  most of us try to do it as “efficiently” as possible  trying to carry as many “valuable” things as possible while trying to avoid paying for extra luggage on airlines    We consider these rational choices    Algorithms are simply “stepbystep procedures to achieve these rational objectives“   If you are an instructor  like me   teaching Algorithms  you might have noticed that most students  around 70%  are intimidated when they take a basic algorithms course    Most of them DO end up doing well in the course  but they consider the process painful    If they reflect on the course  most often they say “that course was a nightmare  I don t remember what I learnt in that course”    They do not seem to have enjoyed the course    Probably they might remember 30% of the material    This is definitely not acceptable for such a fundamental course   Often  when I comeback to my office after teaching  I say to myself  “I should have given them one more example  to help them get better intuition”    You can always do better job if you are given more time    Alas  we have timebounded classes and almost infinite details to cover    We expect students to learn some concepts on their own and develop their own intuitions    We want to give “good” reading material    So  their understanding depends on how well these readings are written   Today s post is about “How to teach Algorithms ?” Here is one of my experiences  while I was teaching an undergrad algorithms course at GeorgiaTech    I was teaching dynamic programming    I gave several examples to make sure that they understand the paradigm    At the end of the class  almost 50% of class had questions  because this is the first time they saw dynamic programming    I told them to see me in my office hours    I quickly implemented a java applet to show how the matrix entries are filled by the algorithm  step by step    When I showed them this applet and a pseudocode sidebyside  highlighting every current line of code being executed   almost all of the students understood the main idea behind dynamic programming    Some of them also said “it is easy”    I was glad and wanted to add more algorithms in my code,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1    Raise the bar for all   It can be a challenge to overcome the socially acceptable thought I was never good at math  says Sarah Bax  a math teacher at Hardy Middle School in Washington  D   C    Rather than being born with or without math talent  kids need to hear from teachers that anyone who works hard can succeed    “It s about helping kids have a growth mindset ” says Bax    “Practice and persistence make you good at math   ” Tell students about the power and importance of math with enthusiasm and high expectations   2    Don t wait—act now!Look ahead to the specific concepts students need to master for annual endofyear tests and pace instruction accordingly    “You don t want to be caught off guard come March thinking that students need to know X for the tests the next month ” says Skip Fennell  project director of Elementary Mathematics Specialists and Teacher Leaders Project and professor emeritus at McDaniel College in Westminster  Maryland    Know the specific standards and backmap your teaching from the fall so students are ready   3    Create a testing pathway   Use formative assessments to ensure that students are understanding the concepts    What you learn can guide your instruction and determine next steps  says Fennell    Testing is not something separate from your instruction    It should be integrated into your planning    Instead of a quick exit question or card  give a fiveminute quiz to confirm students have mastered the math skill covered in the day s lesson    A capable digital resource designed to monitor your students in real time can also be an invaluable tool  providing actionable data to inform your instruction along the way   4    Observe  modify  and reevaluate   Walk through your classroom as students work on problems and observe the dynamics    Talk with students individually and include “hinge questions” in your lessons plans to gauge understanding before continuing  suggests Fennell    In response  make decisions to go faster or slower or put students in groups   5    Personalize and offer choice   When students are given the opportunity to choose how they learn and demonstrate their understanding of a concept  their buyin and motivation increase    It gives them the chance to understand how they learn best  agency over their own learning  and the space to practice different approaches to solving math problems    Give students a variety of options  such as timed exercises  projects  or different materials  to show that they ve mastered foundational skills    As students show what they ve learned  teachers can track understanding  figure out where students need additional scaffolding or other assistance  and tailor lessons accordingly   6    Encourage math talk   Engage students during conversations about their work and have them describe why they solved a problem in a certain way    “My goal is to get information about what students are thinking and use that to guide my instruction  as opposed to just telling them information and asking them to parrot things back ” says Delise Andrews  who taught math  K–8  and is now a 3–5 grade math coordinator in the Lincoln Public Schools in Lincoln  Nebraska    Instead of seeking a specific answer  Andrews wants to have deeper discussions to figure out what a student knows and understands    “True learning happens a lot around talking and doing math—not just drilling ” she says   7    Seek to develop understanding   Meaningful math education goes beyond memorizing formulas and procedures    Set high goals  create space for exploration  and work with the students to develop a strong foundation    “Treat the kids like mathematicians ” says Andrews    Present a broad topic  review various strategies for solving a problem  and then elicit a formula or idea from the kids rather than starting with the formula    This creates a stronger conceptual understanding and mental connections with the material for the student   8    Choose meaningful tasks   Kids get excited about math when they have to solve reallife problems    For instance  when teaching sixth graders how to determine area  present tasks related to a house

If you really think you can do it  go ahead and try  but be mindful of that deercaughtinheadlights stare    It means they don   t understand you  not that they   re stupid   2    Work with associationsIt   s okay to acknowledge E   F    Codd  but your goal is to introduce users to relational database theory and possibly even the SQL language    You could easily provide slides of bulleted rules and guidelines  but don   t    Information provided that way won   t mean much to most users    Instead  take advantage of their familiarity with other common tools  such as spreadsheets and file cabinets    You know that a spreadsheet is not a database  but a sheet is a good way to introduce rows as records  columns as fields  and sheets as tables    Compare what they already know to what they have to learn    You might think this method is old and worn out  but don   t push it aside just because it   s old    It   s old because it works   3    Avoid development tools while learningYou   ll probably want to use an actual database while teaching concepts to run simple examples    Although you could supply a set of client management tools  don   t    All you   ll do is teach your students bad habits — habits that rely on a specific set of management tools rather than concepts    It   s important that your students understand the basics before they learn to interact with the data via visual tools    If you want to apply examples to data  use a commandline interface    In the long run  learning how to type query requests directly will benefit them far more than learning how to use a specific set of tools    Once your students understand the concepts  then introduce them to the visual interface tools   4    Use familiar dataYour users are already working with data that in some way relates to your business    If possible  work with simple examples that rely on that familiar data    It may not seem like much to you  but you   ll eliminate time needed to introduce example data and give users a boost up the learning curve   5    Set aside enough time for implementation and studyYour users won   t retain much if they don   t have an opportunity to put what they   ve learned into action    Assign additional time outside of classroom training for individual experimentation and further learning    Assign homework by presenting a realworld problem and give students a little lab time to find a workable solution    I realize that it might be difficult to get upper management to agree to this request  but nothing can replace handson experience,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Step 1    Introducing Deep Learning If you are reading this and interested in the topic  then you are probably already familiar with what deep neural networks are  if even at a basic level    Neural networks have a storied history  but we won   t be getting into that    We do  however  want a common high level of understanding to begin with   First  have a look at the fantastic introductory videos from DeepLearning   tv    At the time of this writing there are 14 videos    watch them all if you like  but definitely watch the first 5  covering the basics of neural nets and some of the more common architectures   Next  read over the NIPS 2015 Deep Learning Tutorial by Geoff Hinton  Yoshua Bengio  and Yann LeCun for an introduction at a slightly lower level   To round out our first step  read the first chapter of Neural Networks and Deep Learning  the fantastic  evolving online book by Michael Nielsen  which goes a step further but still keeps things fairly light   Step 2    Getting Technical Deep neural nets rely on a mathematical foundation of algebra and calculus    While this post will not produce any theoretical mathematicians  gaining some understanding of the basics before moving on would be helpful   First  watch Andrew Ng   s linear algebra review videos    While not absolutely necessary  for those finding they want something deeper on this subject  consult the Linear Algebra Review and Referencefrom Ng   s Stanford course  written by Zico Kolter and Chuong Do   Then look at this Introduction to the Derivative of a Function video by Professor Leonard    The video is succinct  the examples are clear  and it provides some understanding of what is actually going on during backpropagation from a mathematical standpoint    More on that soon   Next have a quick read over the Wikipedia entry for the Sigmoid function  a bounded differentiable function often employed by individual neurons in a neural network   Finally  take a break from the maths and read this Deep Learning Tutorial by Google research scientist Quoc Le   Step 3    Backpropagation and Gradient Descent An important part of neural networks  including modern deep architectures  is the backward propagation of errors through a network in order to update the weights used by neurons closer to the input    This is  quite bluntly  from where neural networks derive their   power    for lack of better term    Backpropagation for short  or even   backprop     is paired with an optimization method which acts to minimize the weights that are subsequently distributed  via backpropagation   in order to minimize the loss function    A common optimization method in deep neural networks is gradient descent   First  read these introductory notes on gradient descent by Marc Toussaint of the University of Stuttgart   Next  have a look at this step by step example of backpropagation in action written by Matt Mazur   Moving on  read Jeremy Kun   s informative blog post on coding backpropagation in Python    Having a look over the complete code is also suggested  as is attempting to replicate it yourself   Finally  read the second part of the Deep Learning Tutorial by Quoc Le  in order to get introduced to some specific common deep architectures and their uses   Step 4    Getting Practical The specific neural network architectures that will be introduced in the following steps will include practical implementations using some of the most popular Python deep learning libraries present in research today    Since different libraries are  in some cases  optimized for particular neural network architectures  and have established footholds in certain fields of research  we will be making use of 3 separate deep learning libraries    This is not redundant    keeping up with the latest libraries for particular areas of practice is a critical part of learning    The following exercises will also allow you to evaluate different libraries for yourself  and form an intuition as to which to use for which problems   At this point you are welcome to choose any library or combination of libraries to install  and move forward implementing those tutorials which pertain to your choice    If you are looking to try one library and use it to implement one of each of the following steps    tutorials  I would recommend TensorFlow  for a few reasons    I will mention the most relevant  at least  in my view     it performs autodifferentiation  meaning that you  or  rather  the tutorial  does not have to worry about implementing backpropagation from scratch  likely making code easier to follow  especially for a newcomer    I wrote about TensorFlow when it first came out in the post TensorFlow Disappoints – Google Deep Learning Falls Shallow  the title of which suggests that I had more disappointment with it than I actually did    I was primarily focused on its lack of GPU clusterenabled network training  which is likely soon on its way     Anyhow  if you are interested in reading more about TensorFlow without consulting the whitepaper listed below  I would suggest reading my original article  and then following up with Zachary Lipton   s wellwritten piece  TensorFlow is Terrific – A Sober Take on Deep Learning Acceleration   TensorFlowGoogle   s TensorFlow is an allpurpose machine learning library based on data flow graph representation    Install TensorFlow by visiting here Have a look at its whitepaper Try out its introductory tutorial Keep its documentation handyTheanoTheano is actively developed by the LISA group at the University of Montreal    Install Theano by visiting here Try out an introductory tutorial Refer to its documentation hereCaffeCaffe is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center  BVLC  at UC Berkeley    While Theano and TensorFlow can be considered   generalpurpose   deep learning libraries  Caffe  being developed by a computer vision group  is mostly thought of for just such tasks    however  it is also a fully generalpurpose library for use building various deep learning architectures for different domains    Go here to install Caffe Read its introductory tutorial presentation to familiarize yourself Have a look at its documentation as wellKeep in mind that these are not the only popular libraries in use today    In fact  there are many  many others to choose from  and these were selected based on the prevelance of tutorials  documentation  and acceptance among research in general   Other deep learning library options include    Keras  a highlevel  minimalist Python neural network library for Theano and TensorFlow Lasagne  lightweight Python library for atop Theano Torch  Lua machine learning algorithm library Deeplearning4j  open source  distributed deep learning library for Java and Scala Chainer  a flexible  intuitive Python neural network library Mocha  a deep learning framework for JuliaWith libraries installed  we now move on to practical implementation   Step 5    Convolutional Neural Nets and Computer Vision Computer vision deals with the processing and understanding of images and its symbolic information    Most of the field   s recent breakthroughs have come from the use of deep neural networks    In particular  convolutional neural networks have played a very important role in computer vision of late   The convolutional neural network   First  read this deep learning with computer vision tutorial by Yoshua Bengio  in order to gain an understanding of the topic   Next  if you have TensorFlow installed  take a look at  and implement  this tutorial  which classifies CIFAR10 images using a convolutional neural network   If you have Caffe installed  as an alternative to the above tutorial  or alongside   implement a convolutional neural network in Caffe for classifying MNIST dataset images   Here is a Theano tutorial which is roughly equivalent to the above Caffe exercise   Afterward  read a seminal convolutional neural network paper by Krizhevsky  Sutskever  and Hinton for additional insight   Step 6    Recurrent Nets and Language Processing Natural language processing  NLP  is another domain which has seen benefits from deep learning    Concerned with understanding natural  human  languages  NLP has had a number of its most recent successes come by way of recurrent neural networks  RNN    Andrej Karpathy has a fantastic blog post titled   The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks   which outlines the effectiveness of RNNs in training characterlevel language models    The code it references is written in Lua using Torch  so you can skip over that    the post is still useful on a purely conceptual level   This tutorial implements a recurrent neural in TensorFlow for language modeling   You can then use Theano and try your hand at this tutorial  which implements a recurrent neural network with word embeddings   Finally  you can read Yoon Kim   s Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification for another application of CNNs in language processing    Denny Britz has a blog post titled   Implementing A CNN For Text Classification in TensorFlow    which does just as it suggests using movie review data   Step 7    Further Topics The previous steps have progressed from theoretical to practical topics in deep learning    By installing and implementing convolutional neural nets and recurrent neural nets in the previous 2 steps  it is hoped that one has gained a preliminary appreciation for their power and functionality    As prevalent as CNNs and RNNs are  there are numerous other deep architectures in existence  with additional emerging from research on a regular basis   There are also numerous other considerations for deep learning beyond those presented in the earlier theoretical steps  and as such  the following is a quick survey of some of these additional architectures and concerns   For a further understanding of a particular type of recurrent neural network suited for time series prediction  the Long Short Term Memory Network  read this article by Christopher Olah,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
Step 1    Basic Python Skills If we intend to leverage Python in order to perform machine learning  having some base understanding of Python is crucial    Fortunately  due to its widespread popularity as a general purpose programming language  as well as its adoption in both scientific computing and machine learning  coming across beginner   s tutorials is not very difficult    Your level of experience in both Python and programming in general are crucial to choosing a starting point   First  you need Python installed    Since we will be using scientific computing and machine learning packages at some point  I suggest that you install Anaconda    It is an industrialstrength Python implementation for Linux  OSX  and Windows  complete with the required packages for machine learning  including numpy  scikitlearn  and matplotlib    It also includes iPython Notebook  an interactive environment for many of our tutorials    I would suggest Python 2   7  for no other reason than it is still the dominant installed version   If you have no knowledge of programming  my suggestion is to start with the following free online book  then move on to the subsequent materials    Python The Hard Way  by Zed A    ShawIf you have experience in programming but not with Python in particular  or if your Python is elementary  I would suggest one or both of the following    Google Developers Python Course  highly recommended for visual learners  An Introduction to Python for Scientific Computing  from UCSB Engineering   by M    Scott Shell  a great scientific Python intro ~60 pages And for those looking for a 30 minute crash course in Python  here you go    Learn X in Y Minutes  X = Python Of course  if you are an experienced Python programmer you will be able to skip this step    Even if so  I suggest keeping the very readable Python documentation handy   Step 2    Foundational Machine Learning Skills KDnuggets    own Zachary Lipton has pointed out that there is a lot of variation in what people consider a   data scientist      This actually is a reflection of the field of machine learning  since much of what data scientists do involves using machine learning algorithms to varying degrees    Is it necessary to intimately understand kernel methods in order to efficiently create and gain insight from a support vector machine model? Of course not    Like almost anything in life  required depth of theoretical understanding is relative to practical application    Gaining an intimate understanding of machine learning algorithms is beyond the scope of this article  and generally requires substantial amounts of time investment in a more academic setting  or via intense selfstudy at the very least   The good news is that you don   t need to possess a PhDlevel understanding of the theoretical aspects of machine learning in order to practice  in the same manner that not all programmers require a theoretical computer science education in order to be effective coders   Andrew Ng   s Coursera course often gets rave reviews for its content    my suggestion  however  is to browse the course notes compiled by a former student of the online course   s previous incarnation    Skip over the Octavespecific notes  a Matlablike language unrelated to our Python pursuits     Be warned that these are not   official   notes  but do seem to capture the relevant content from Andrew   s course material    Of course  if you have the time and interest  now would be the time to take Andrew Ng   s Machine Learning course on Coursera    Unofficial Andrew Ng course notesThere all sorts of video lectures out there if you prefer  alongside Ng   s course mentioned above    I   m a fan of Tom Mitchell  so here   s a link to his recent lecture videos  along with MariaFlorina Balcan   which I find particularly approachable    Tom Mitchell Machine Learning LecturesYou don   t need all of the notes and videos at this point    A valid strategy involves moving forward to particular exercises below  and referencing applicable sections of the above notes and videos when appropriate    For example  when you come across an exercise implementing a regression model below  read the appropriate regression section of Ng   s notes and/or view Mitchell   s regression videos at that time   Step 3    Scientific Python Packages Overview Alright    We have a handle on Python programming and understand a bit about machine learning    Beyond Python there are a number of open source libraries generally used to facilitate practical machine learning    In general  these are the main socalled scientific Python libraries we put to use when performing elementary machine learning tasks  there is clearly subjectivity in this     numpy  mainly useful for its Ndimensional array objects pandas  Python data analysis library  including structures such as dataframes matplotlib  2D plotting library producing publication quality figures scikitlearn  the machine learning algorithms used for data analysis and data mining tasksA good approach to learning these is to cover this material    Scipy Lecture Notes  by Gaël Varoquaux  Emmanuelle Gouillart  and Olav VahtrasThis pandas tutorial is good  and to the point    10 Minutes to PandasYou will see some other packages in the tutorials below  including  for example  Seaborn  which is a data visualization library based on matplotlib    The aforementioned packages are  again  subjectively  the core of a wide array of machine learning tasks in Python    however  understanding them should let you adapt to additional and related packages without confusion when they are referenced in the following tutorials   Step 4    Getting Started with Machine Learning in Python Python    Check    Machine learning fundamentals    Check    Numpy    Check    Pandas    Check    Matplotlib    Check   The time has come    Let   s start implementing machine learning algorithms with Python   s de factostandard machine learning library  scikitlearn   The scikitlearn flow chart   Many of the following tutorials and exercises will be driven by the iPython  Jupyter  Notebook  which is an interactive environment for executing Python    These iPython notebooks can optionally be viewed online or downloaded and interacted with locally on your own computer    iPython Notebook Overview from StanfordAlso note that the tutorials below are from a number of online sources    All Notebooks have been attributed to the authors    if  for some reason  you find that someone has not been properly credited for their work  please let me know and the situation will be rectified ASAP    In particular  I would like to tip my hat to Jake VanderPlas  Randal Olson  Donne Martin  Kevin Markham  and Colin Raffel for their fantastic freelyavailable resources   Our first tutorials for getting our feet wet with scikitlearn follow    I suggest doing all of these in order before moving to the following steps   A general introduction to scikitlearn  Python   s mostused general purpose machine learning library  covering the knearest neighbors algorithm    An Introduction to scikitlearn  by Jake VanderPlasA more indepth and expanded introduction  including a starter project with a wellknown dataset from start to finish    Example Machine Learning Notebook  by Randal OlsonA focus on strategies for evaluating different models in scikitlearn  covering train/test dataset splits    Model Evaluation  by Kevin MarkhamStep 5    Machine Learning Topics with Python With a foundation having been laid in scikitlearn  we can move on to some more indepth explorations of the various common  and useful  algorithms    We start with kmeans clustering  one of the most wellknown machine learning algorithms    It is a simple and often effective method for solving unsupervised learning problems    kmeans Clustering  by Jake VanderPlasNext  we move back toward classification  and take a look at one of the most historically popular classification methods    Decision Trees via The Grimm ScientistFrom classification  we look at continuous numeric prediction    Linear Regression  by Jake VanderPlasWe can then leverage regression for classification problems  via logistic regression    Logistic Regression  by Kevin MarkhamStep 6    Advanced Machine Learning Topics with Python We   ve gotten our feet wet with scikitlearn  and now we turn our attention to some more advanced topics    First up are support vector machines  a notnecessarilylinear classifier relying on complex transformations of data into higher dimensional space    Support Vector Machines  by Jake VanderPlasNext  random forests  an ensemble classifier  are examined via a Kaggle Titanic Competition walkthrough    Kaggle Titanic Competition  with Random Forests   by Donne MartinDimensionality reduction is a method for reducing the number of variables being considered in a problem    Principal Component Analysis is a particular form of unsupervised dimensionality reduction    Dimensionality Reduction  by Jake VanderPlasBefore moving on to the final step  we can take a moment to consider that we have come a long way in a relatively short period of time   Using Python and its machine learning libraries  we have covered some of the most common and wellknown machine learning algorithms  knearest neighbors  kmeans clustering  support vector machines   investigated a powerful ensemble technique  random forests   and examined some additional machine learning support tasks  dimensionality reduction  model validation techniques     Along with some foundational machine learning skills  we have started filling a useful toolkit for ourselves   We will add one more indemand tool to that kit before wrapping up   Step 7    Deep Learning in Python Deep learning is everywhere! Deep learning builds on neural network research going back several decades  but recent advances dating to the past several years have dramatically increased the perceived power of  and general interest in  deep neural networks    If you are unfamiliar with deep learning  KDnuggets has many articles detailing the numerous recent innovations  accomplishments  and accolades of the technology   This final step does not purport to be a deep learning clinic of any sort    we will take a look at a few simple network implementations in 2 of the leading contemporary Python deep learning libraries    For those interested in digging deeper into deep learning  I recommend starting with the following free online book    Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael NielsenTheanoTheano is the first Python deep learning library we will look at    From the authors   Theano is a Python library that allows you to define  optimize  and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multidimensional arrays efficiently   The following introductory tutorial on deep learning in Theano is lengthy  but it is quite good  very descriptive  and heavilycommented    Theano Deep Learning Tutorial  by Colin RaffelCaffeThe other library we will test drive is Caffe    Again  from the authors   Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression  speed  and modularity in mind    It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center  BVLC  and by community contributors   This tutorial is the cherry on the top of this article    While we have undertaken a few interesting examples above  none likely compete with the following  which is implementing Google   s #DeepDreamusing Caffe    Enjoy this one! After understanding the tutorial  play around with it to get your processors dreaming on their own    Dreaming Deep with Caffe via Google   s GitHubI didn   t promise it would be quick or easy  but if you put the time in and follow the above 7 steps  there is no reason that you won   t be able to claim reasonable proficiency and understanding in a number of machine learning algorithms and their implementation in Python using its popular libraries  including some of those on the cutting edge of current deep learning research   Bio    Matthew Mayo is a computer science graduate student currently working on his thesis parallelizing machine learning algorithms    He is also a student of data mining  a data enthusiast  and an aspiring machine learning scientist,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
1    Establish a Coding ClubA coding club can give students the opportunity to build applications together and learn about software    You can step in as project manager  helping students stay on track with the project and eliminate bugs in the software    Choose a theme each year and let students come together and exchange ideas on what to code    Use Facebook pages to host discussions about the projects you work on  or keep a club blog where students take turns describing their hand in the process   2    Gamify the IdeaOne of the strengths that Web applications like Codecademy have is their ability to gamify the concept of learning    In video games  you get positive reinforcement for accomplishing your goals    This reinforcement comes in the form of making a character stronger  giving better equipment  or generally granting powers that assist the player in completing objectives   The idea is to give students methods of gaining experience  either by passing quizzes  turning in homework or participating    A “hall of Fame” where students can brag about their accomplishments is a great start  but you can change how you grade to incorporate gaining levels   3    Demo Practical IdeasShowing students practical things they can do with code will help get them excited    Codea for the iPad comes with games and geometric shapes that amateur coders can play with to learn the “Lua” programming language    Python can easily double as a calculator for complicated math courses  and HTML or PHP color just about every popular website around   ?

Rails for Zombies challenges students to learn Ruby on Rails to help avoid the zombie apocalypse!? Tynker lets kids create art and simple video games using coding tags and manipulating values   The more fun and interesting you can make the supplemental resources  the better for them    Incentivize their participation with extra credit  or experience points    10    Involve ParentsNo matter what you teach in the classroom  involve the parents and let them know your hopes for the program    Explain the need for technologists and help them understand that you need their help to reinforce the concepts your teaching    Ask them to get more involved with children s projects and to follow along with the supplemental materials you provide    Lastly  explain that you were a novice just like them  and that even old dogs can learn new tricks with the right reinforcement,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
As apps and digital projects become more important to how we live and play  learning how to design and create those ideas is going to become more important as well   And if the current trend continues  more accessible than ever   While many coding resources for students exist  many of these look like they were designed by lifeless robots    Coding already has a reputation as geeky  dry  and alphanumeric  as opposed to the svelte  elegant  and engaging interaction that code produces    Kind of ironic   HopScotch is an iPad app that introduces students to the concept of coding by using simple graphics  lots of color  and easy to use tools   Using HopScotch  students can become familiar with the relationship with numbers and letters here  and subsequent movement or animation there     Which isn t always the case when writing code    Coding is as much about planning  structure  design  and careful processes as it is software and programs–which  as an aside  makes it a brilliant way to teach the writing process itself    Plan  Draft  Revise  Edit  and Publish–but in code   The biggest draw for this app is easily its simplicity    It doesn t have the ambition of Code Academy  or the power of Codea    It s just a basic app to help students understand how code works  with the bonus of a graphic interface that s a bit more engaging than what they might see in other apps,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Facial recognition is just one example of what machine learning can achieve — and it s one of the more controversial    Drawing from a vast pool of digital images  computers can now identify individuals based on facial patterns    In China  it s already being used to identify suspects and even autotext tickets to jaywalkers    While the ethical implications of such technology are enormous  it also makes a great entry point for teaching kids how machine learning works   Since a computer can t “see” a photo the way a human does  how can it extract meaningful data from one photo and compare it with data from another? In this activity  students simulate a facial recognition algorithm by breaking down images of Disney characters into a list of features they can then use to glean the identity of a mystery character   AI may be a revolutionary technology  but you don t need any apps or devices to teach its basic concepts,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Rather than attempt to measure a computer s ability to think  mathematician Alan Turing argued that a more practical way to assess a machine s intelligence is to test its ability to mimic human behavior    To pass the Turing test  a machine must be able to fool a human into thinking it is also human    Students can act out their own version of the Turing test using a list of questions and answers    You ll need three volunteers    One will act as the computer  responding to questions using only the answers provided  while another will act as the human  answering questions as they see fit    both should be located outside the classroom    The third volunteer will convey their answers back to the class  which must then determine which is the human and which is the computer,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
Artificial intelligence is a bit of a misnomer  scientists admit    True AI is still at least a decade off    what we re seeing now may be better described as “augmented intelligence ” or the use of machines to augment what humans are capable of    Instead of preprogramming a computer to perform a specific task  we re now able to feed it data and let it discover patterns and learn tasks on its own    In other words  we have machines that can make predictions — and get better at them — based on a library of data    That s still a far cry from a robot that can think for itself    This activity uses a game of Tic Tac Toe to demonstrate the difference between human and artificial intelligence    The game pits a human player against a piece of paper “preprogrammed” with instructions    As students watch the paper respond to each move  they discover how  with the right programming  a computer can adapt to human responses and appear to equal  or even best  a human opponent,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The notion that computer science education is essential for all is picking up steam in the United States    however  we still are a long way from making it accessible and equitable for all    The reality is that so far only five states across the U   S    require all K12 students access to computer science education and only 12 states have made a policy pledge to offer computer science courses in high schools   This leads us to the essential question    How can we help promote equal and fair access to education of computer science concepts and integration of computational thinking practices across core content areas for all students?The ISTE Standards for Students advocate for empowering student voice  while ensuring that learning is a studentdriven process    I would like to quote two specific ISTE Standards for Students to set some context for our discussion   1    Innovative Designer    Students use a variety of technologies within a design process to identify and solve problems by creating new  useful or imaginative solutions   2    Computational Thinker    Students develop and employ strategies for understanding and solving problems in ways that leverage the power of technological methods to develop and test solutions   Physical computing provides educators with the unique opportunity to address these two standards    It is an accessible teaching tool that supports all learners in exploring computational thinking practices and computer science concepts across multiple disciplines in creative ways  using constructionist approaches    Physical computing is specifically intriguing as a educational tool because of its concrete connection between the “real” physical world and the virtual one  especially as students and educators build indepth understanding and more authentic connections between different curricula  disciplines  knowledge and practice   In a broader context  to address the “accessibility for all” gap  make the CSforALL accessibility pledge and help rally the national community of CS education content creators  program providers  educational institutions  researchers and investors take immediate steps to achieve accessibility for existing efforts  and ensure that future efforts address accessibility within the design phase   Interested in learning more?

Step 1    Identify the problemWhen students are new to CP  we typically start teaching them how to program and code using tutorials    Although there s nothing wrong with that  we don t want to keep them there   Usually the writer of a tutorial has already identified both the problem and the solution of the program    The best way for kids to learn is by writing their own problems and solutions and creating their own programs    Otherwise  they will focus more on learning to code specific functions in a particular language  which is generally no different than rote memorization  which should be replaced with the development of working memory   Identifying  or defining  the problem is the most critical part of the CP process as students will need to develop a concrete plan for what their complete program will do    This process involves identifying both the known inputs  or given data  and what is to be obtained via outputs  the result     Although CP isn t a simple process  consistent and precise practice will build student confidence over time in articulating the details on the kind of input  processing and output desired for their programs    To get students started in programming  read this great intro to a lesson for building and sharing apps by Code   org   Step 2    Find a solutionTo find or plan the solution to the problem identified in Step 1  students can either create a flowchart or write pseudocode    Experienced programmers can and will use either of these methods to convey program development to clients  teachers  etc   A flowchart is a stepbystep solution to a problem that uses a pictorial representation of the direction of the program and consists of arrows  boxes and other symbols that represent actions  i   e     input/output  process  etc        Pseudocode is similar to English and is used to convey the solution with more accuracy than in plain English — but with less meticulousness required by a formal programming language   The solution process enables the programmer to focus on the logical flow of the program without having to adhere to the actual syntax used by the programming language for the project    Check out this fun Technovation lesson to help your students plan their code   Step 3    Code itOften coding is confused with programming  but coding is just one part of the programming process    Good coders can create instructions from the solutions  discussed in Step 2  and write them into code for the computer to understand    This is where the algorithmic design skills from computational thinking come into play   It helps when you think of your problem as a math problem  not because you re always doing a lot of math while programming  but because the thought process is the same    In mathematics we often use algorithmic sets of instructions that we follow in a sequence of steps to achieve a goal    That process is likened to both a welldetailed flowchart and code  in a specific programming language     Practicing coding will help students understand that coding isn t complicated when they learn how to think logically and in steps    Getting students started by writing simple programs will teach them how to give computers instructions  how computers actually work and that good coders aren t vague and don t skip steps    They will also understand that the code they write is processed  translated  by a compiler into machine language for execution   For kids new to coding  I recommend starting with a visual programming language  VPL   which allows kids to describe their algorithms using illustrations and lets coders describe the process in terms that make sense to them   Here are some popular VPLs   Scratch  ScratchJrBlocklyArdublock  block programming language for Arduino ROBOLAB  programming language for LEGO Robotics ROBOTC  graphical for VEX Robotics LabVIEW  National Instruments Although there are several ways to get students started in coding  I highly recommend your entire school participate in an Hour of Code and also teach kids to code within the context of a STEM/STEAM design challenge   Step 4    Test itTesting in CP is a critical process used to determine the quality of a program and find bugs  problems     As a college intern  I was first introduced to testing and debugging of ActiveX Controls in the Visual Basic programming language    Although testing has different levels and will determine if programs work or don t — working to find bugs for the software developers to correct was very powerful in helping me understand the quality of the programs I used every day and also the importance of updating them regularly    Requiring students to present their work publicly  is an excellent technique for engaging and instilling in them the importance of the testing process for discussing and showcasing highquality CS work    Again  the App Lab  in Step 1  is a great lesson and project for helping kids learn CP from start to testing,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Pair programming is a software development technique that puts two people at one workstation where they team up to do what a single programmer would typically do – but with improved outcomes because the pairing leads to fewer defects  optimized thinking  knowledge sharing and increased information flow between the partners     The joke in tech circles is that the two developers are “handcuffed” to each other until the project is completed    In reality  the programmers take on different roles while paired up    One person  the “driver ” writers code while the “navigator” reviews the code as it s written   Tara Linney  edtech coach at the Singapore American School  compares the approach to taking a taxi in Singapore where the GPS is sketchy and cooperation is required to get to your destination   “I don t give the driver an address ” Linney says    “I give him landmarks and tell him which way to go and I correct him as he drives    So one person is the voice who navigates and helps troubleshoot and the other person  the driver  does the work   ”She says the approach helps programmers debug coding because it allows for problemsolving with new eyes   In the classroom  the paired approach leads to authentic learning    “It empowers students to communicate and collaborate and fosters critical thinking because the teacher is part of the background  a facilitator ” Linney says    It also addresses a number of ISTE Standards for Students  including Creative Communicator  Computational Thinker and Innovative Designer    Linney pairs boys up with girls and matches students with similar traits rather than ability levels – like putting talkative students together or quiet students together – so both students have an equal opportunity to have a voice   That s when the magic happens and students benefit from gender equity and socialemotional learning  including   PerspectiveWhen students have an interaction with someone who is different from them it presents an opportunity to develop empathy and gain new perspectives    Stick with the people just like you or who you re already comfortable with and socialemotional learning stagnates   Adjusted focus  Linney says girls tend to focus on purpose when creating  while boys might focus on fun – think game creation    Create mixedgender teams and boys experience the purpose aspect– how and why things work and making a difference in the world – and discover a different way of thinking   Solution findingWhat the world needs now is fixers and problemsolvers  but solutions don t come from getting it right the first time or being perfect    Pair programming sets up a situation where one student sees another student s approach and views the problem from a different angle   Iteration mindsetPairing girls and boys enables girls  who tend to home in on the end product   to focus on individual steps and solving the problems that may arise during creation  making the idea of iteration more comfortable,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Computer networking is something which many ICT teachers shy away from and even some of the most knowledgeable computing teachers have only covered the subject briefly during their degrees  often only covering the theory    There are various places which networking comes into at both GCSE and A level  with various expectations of the students being set    One of the most enjoyable units I have taught at A level is assessed by a ten hour exam  with students designing and costing a network to fit a given problem    This may sound very daunting  but approached in the right way  it leaves students inspired and more importantly with some life skills and knowledge for the future   When a subject is so different from anything covered before  you have to find an angle to get through to your class    The good thing about networking is they are doing it all the time  hopefully not when they should be listening to you! Mobile phones are the most accessible networking device you have and work in a way that everyone understands  this is a good place to start as the students are the experts   Networking computers is well documented and many exam boards will point you to either the Seven Layer OSI Model or the TCP/IP Model or indeed both   The fundamental principle you will need to get across is that  to communicate everyone in the network needs an identity    Mobile phones are not much use if you don t know someone else s number  which is unique to that phone  or SIM card     All phone networks have different numbers at the start  this is significant because the system needs to know where to send it  this will become important later in your term when you talk about routing     When you call a number it will only ever call that number and as long as the phone is on and they have a signal the call should go through    So having numbers is an easy way to identify someone  in computing the numbers are called IP addresses and consist of four sets of numbers separated by dots  at this point they don t need to know about the structure  other than how the numbers are separated into a network identity and a host    In a mobile phone number the first four digits identify the network  this is how the system has been set up  whether for mobile numbers or area codes on the landline structure    In computer networking the computers have to be told which part is the network identity by applying a Subnet Mask    This is another set of numbers which tells the computers to separate off part of the IP Address  again the actual numbers will complicate this so just think of a mask separating off the first three of the four sets  this is the easiest class of network to start with     At this point I like to make it practical  if you have some stickers or sheets to identify different groups this makes it very visual   It would be easy to start at the bottom and work your way through the layers  but the class will probably switch off half way through your explanation of UTP cabling and RJ45s    The excitement of networking comes when things happen  mobile phones become interesting when you get a call  text or BBM and computers are no different    Before the Internet  computers had their uses but they weren t as exciting as they are now    They will all accept that there are many ways of connecting devices  including wired and wireless    So to grab your students  start at the exciting layer – Network  or Internet in TCP/IP     The objective you have is to introduce IP addresses  Subnet Mask and Default Gateway   Either split the team into groups or use some students as examples  I wouldn t go for more than four or five    Give each group a sticker with an IP address on  making sure you have masked off the network portion   Eg  192   168   0   101             192   168   0   102          192   168   0   103           192   168   0   104The yellow parts identify the network  leaving a unique number for each group    Now get yourself some envelopes and organise a set of messages to be sent to certain addresses    A message can only be sent in a sealed envelope  with the address of the recipient and the address of who it was sent by labelled on the front and back    Set a strict time limit and let them get on with it    If the activity is successful each group should have a full set of messages  which perhaps make up a whole story  or set of notes     You can also put in spoof messages with incorrect network addresses  which should end up going to no one    As the envelopes are opened teams either get a full set or something goes wrong  in which case you can trouble shoot who sent the wrong messages    The envelopes can actually be referred to as ‘Packets   which again will be useful later on in the topic   Hopefully by the end of your session the class should have an idea about network addresses and how this is used to network computers together  the only thing you haven t covered is the default gateway  which is the door out of your local network    This can be tied up with the envelopes which have the addresses which don t belong to your groups    You become the default gateway  give yourself the last IP address  if you are using the examples given this would be 192   168   0   254  and say you will deal with those packets as you can contact networks outside the group – walking out of the classroom door often raises an eyebrow!As an absolute starter for students who have no knowledge of how networking actually happens  this provides lots of different examples for visual  audio and Kinetic learners,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
The details of a risk management process are beyond the scope of this document  however if thereis a welldesigned risk based framework for evaluating security the users will enjoy a greater degreeof freedom and flexibility than might otherwise be the case   Each proposed technical solution or change to the infrastructure needs to be assessed by anappropriately skilled and experienced person    The outcomes of the assessment can be shared withthe management team  teacher requesting the change and the technical support team    A riskaverseleadership team may only accept a situation where the probability of something going wrong is lowand the impact is also low    Where the right culture exists a more relaxed approach may be possible    FINAL School ICT Infrastructure Requirements for Teaching Computing Version 1   5Page 19 of 37In practice a combination of technical and organisational policy controls will be employed tominimise risk as far as is reasonably possible for high and medium impact situations    An examplemight be to only allow students to run executable files inside a virtual machine that can tcommunicate with the rest of the network because the probability that they can compromise therest of the network will be significantly reduced by doing this    However  stopping the running of filesdoes not have to mean that students cannot then store their work inside their home directories   Computer networks can be configured in many ways and by regularly attending recognised trainingcourses provided by vendors like RM20  the support team can be aware of the risks  standardapproaches and common pitfalls    Inhouse support staff can also take advantage of courses andcertifications provided by Microsoft if the school subscribes to the IT Academy programme21 whichprovides a wide range of resources and materials that could benefit them as well as teachers andstudents,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
 Many students will have prior knowledge about computer hardware    Begin class with a discussion on computer hardware    o What is computer hardware? o What are some examples of computer hardware? o When students give you an example  ask  what job does is accomplished with this piece of hardware? o Is there a similar piece of hardware that accomplishes the same task  only differently? ? Watch video on what is inside the computer    o What was one thing that you learned when watching the video? You can utilize http   //todaysmeet   com/ to have students type in their response  and share with the class    ? Provide students with time to read and reflect on How Stuff Works    What s Inside My Computer? article    http   //computer   howstuffworks   com/insidecomputer   htm    Reflections can be in form of 2 columns    one for quotes    one for reflection OR in any form teacher chooses    ? Ask students to share any of their reflections with the class    ? Go over project plan and objectives    Share rubric with students    Discuss various options of Web 2   0 tools and programming tools that can be used to complete project    ? Divide students up into groups    At this point  you may not know your students  abilities  so you may want to group randomly  or allow students to choose their own groups    Groups of 2 will probably be best    ? Students should spend roughly 2 – 3 days researching and creating their projects    Time outside of class may need to be contributed if students are unable to complete their work in class    ? Presentations    Students will share their projects with the class    Time spent on presentations will vary depending on class size    If time is an issue  consider having projects loaded on computers  having students examine and rate projects in a round robin fashion    Require students to evaluate a certain number of student projects  and turn in their rating sheet    ?

Computer labs should be   open   in format  which means that teaching should be done in the classroom before interaction with the computer occurs  with the lab used for students to work at their own pace on the class assignment    Contrary to the open lab approach    the    commandresponse    method of having the instructor give computer commands and requiring the entire class to respond with the PC is particularly ineffective with adult learners    Lantis  1994  p    84     The   commandresponse   method requires the entire class to proceed at the same pace  obeying commands without really understanding why  and should a student fall behind  because of a computer glitch or for whatever reason  frustration ensues and  unlike other types of classes  it is very difficult to   catch up      The   open lab   approach allows the student to pay full attention to the teacher   s instructions and take notes if necessary  whereas in the commandresponse method  the student must  a  look at the teacher and listen to instructions   b  take notes in order to remember instructions   3  put the notetaking pencil down   4  look at the computer monitor   5  look at and/or type on the keyboard   6  follow teacher   s commands   7  pick up the notetaking pencil and start all over aagain             all at the same time! Even a few seconds of having to keep up with the command approach can be frustrating to the computer anxious    panic soon follows and any learning completely shuts down,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
The system of pairing students is especially helpful in learning about computers and in reducing the stress associated with learning    Surveying students ahead of time to find out their level of experience or anxiety allows the teacher to pair students with similar experiences together or perhaps pair a student with slightly more experience with one having less experience so that students can get needed help without feeling intimidated,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
Hello everyone I love to repair computers  but what I really love is to teach others how to understand/repair computers    I attempt to simplify any kind of explanation so that even the novice can understand what I m teaching    Here is how I teach/explain the seven major computer components   1  MotherboardThe motherboard is the heart of the computer    Every other computer part either sits on  or connects to  the motherboard in some way    The motherboard is the rectangular colored board that sits at the bottom of the case   2  CPUThe CPU  Central Processing Unit  is the brain of the computer    It runs the software and processes the data that you are working on    The CPU sits on top of the motherboard and is covered up by a heat sink and cooling fan   3  RAMRAM  Random Access Memory  holds or remembers the data of the software that you are currently running    The RAM modules  “sticks”  are long and thin and look like a short ruler    Each RAM module snaps into a corresponding slot on the motherboard   4  Video CardThe video card creates the images that appear on the computer monitor    Almost all modern day video cards attach to either the AGP  Accelerated Graphics Port  slot  or to the PCI Express  Peripheral Component Interconnect Express  slot on the motherboard   5  Power SupplyThe power supply supplies the power that the computer needs    All wires going from the power supply go either directly to the computer components or to the motherboard    The power supply sits at the top of the case   6  Hard Disk DriveThe Hard Drive holds all of your information  even when the computer power is off     When you turn on the computer  the software and data load from the Hard Drive into the RAM    The Hard Drive slides into the Hard Drive bay in your computer case   7  Optical DriveThe optical drive uses a laser to read  play  or write  record  burn  CDs and DVDs    The optical drive sits in the front bay of the computer   Professor Randy says    Fix a man s computer and you will satisfy him for today  teach a man how to fix computers and you may satisfy him for a lifetime!“Give a man a fish    you have fed him for today     Teach a man to fish    and you have fed him for a lifetime”—Author unknown “Give a man a fish    you have fed him for today     Teach a man to fish    and you have fed him for a lifetime”—Author unknown Give a man a fish    you have fed him for today     Teach a man to fish    and you have fed him for a lifetime”—Author unknown “Give a man a fish    you have fed him for today     Teach a man to fish    and you have fed him for a lifetime”—Author unknown,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
 The Motherboard   Whenever you build a new system or upgrade an old one  you had better think motherboard first    Without doubt the motherboard is the #1 key piece to your system  so please spend a lot of time considering which one you re going to get and why    Consider the following essential facts   1  The motherboard is the largest single component that is in your machine   2  The motherboard contains the motherboard chipset which will dictate the type of CPU that you can use   3  The type of motherboard and motherboard chipset will dictate the kind of memory that you can use   4  The controller circuitry built into the motherboard will dictate the type of Hard Drive that will be used   Just a few years ago you were stuck with the motherboard and CPU that came in your computer    If you wanted to upgrade  you had to change the entire computer    Modern day mobo processor sockets can now handle many different CPUs    For example    Ivy Bridge Core i3  cheaper   Core i5  medium priced   Core i7  expensive  will all fit in the same socket and all will work just fine in the same compatible motherboard! Just pop out one CPU and put in another one and you re “good to go”!Two of my favorite motherboards at the moment are the ASRock Z77 Extreme4  Intel   and the ASUS M5A97  AMD     Both of these boards are a great value and will easily do what most users need to do with their systems    Match up these great motherboards with the appropriate CPU type and you ll be “one happy camper”!!Professor Randy says    Build or upgrade your system from the ground up! The #1 foundational piece of your system is the motherboard    Consider your needs and put a lot of time and effort into choosing the appropriate board,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1    Work with associationsIt   s okay to acknowledge E   F    Codd  but your goal is to introduce users to relational database theory and possibly even the SQL language    You could easily provide slides of bulleted rules and guidelines  but don   t    Information provided that way won   t mean much to most users    Instead  take advantage of their familiarity with other common tools  such as spreadsheets and file cabinets    You know that a spreadsheet is not a database  but a sheet is a good way to introduce rows as records  columns as fields  and sheets as tables    Compare what they already know to what they have to learn    You might think this method is old and worn out  but don   t push it aside just because it   s old    It   s old because it works   2    Avoid development tools while learningYou   ll probably want to use an actual database while teaching concepts to run simple examples    Although you could supply a set of client management tools  don   t    All you   ll do is teach your students bad habits — habits that rely on a specific set of management tools rather than concepts    It   s important that your students understand the basics before they learn to interact with the data via visual tools    If you want to apply examples to data  use a commandline interface    In the long run  learning how to type query requests directly will benefit them far more than learning how to use a specific set of tools    Once your students understand the concepts  then introduce them to the visual interface tools   3    Use familiar dataYour students are already working with data that in some way relates to your daily life    If possible  work with simple examples that rely on that familiar data    It may not seem like much to you  but you   ll eliminate time needed to introduce example data and give users a boost up the learning curve   4    Set aside enough time for implementation and studyYour students won   t retain much if they don   t have an opportunity to put what they   ve learned into action    Assign additional time outside of classroom training for individual experimentation and further learning    Assign homework by presenting a realworld problem and give students a little lab time to find a workable solution,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
A    Stack Stack is a data structure in which data can be inserted and extracted from only one end    It is a LAST INFIRST OUT  LIFO  structure    Stack can be explained with the help of role play    Ask one of the students to go from classroom in his department to the administrative office and inform him to note down the directions he changed like left to right turn or right to left turn etc    When student comes back from administrative office to classroom ask him the steps he followed to come back    The steps he followed are exact opposite of those steps he followed while going from classroom to administrative office    This is how stack works    Elements can be retrieved in reverse order of the order in which they are inserted    B    Queue Queue is a data structure in which data can be inserted from one end and extracted from another end    It is a FIRST INFIRST OUT  FIFO  structure    Mechanism of working of queue can be explained by conducting an activity    Inform all the students to come in the classroom one after another in a queue    Any student can come in the classroom only after all his predecessors have come in    This demonstrates the working of queue  in which elements are input from one end and output from another end    C    Searching and Sorting Techniques There are two searching techniques linear search and binary search  which can be used to find the element in the given list    There are many sorting techniques like Bubble sort  Insertion sort  Selection sort  Merge sort  Quick sort  Heap sort  Radix sort etc to arrange the elements in either ascending or descending order    It is very difficult to explain algorithms of searching and sorting techniques with traditional teaching methods and chalk and talk    Working of these algorithms can be explained with the help of animation    This can be done by taking sample input and playing animation to show the execution of different steps of algorithm for given numbers    Students will be able to differentiate between these algorithms by watching animation    Empressr  EWC Presenter and GoAnimate are some tools which can be used to create animations    D    Towers of Hanoi Some of the concepts can be explained with the help of multimedia games    Games help to create interest in students with fun and excitement    Students tend to learn more curiously with the help of games    A Towers of Hanoi is one of the difficult concepts to teach    There are given disks of different sizes and three pegs    It is expected to move disks from one peg to another with the help of third peg as temporary without keeping larger disk on top of smaller disk    This problem is NPHard    It can t be solved in polynomial time    This concept can be taught with the help of multimedia game    Three pegs will be displayed on window    Source peg consist of all disks    Students can be asked to move these disked from source to one of the pegs called as destination by using third peg as temporary    Restrictions can be provided by not allowing student to keep larger size disk on top of smaller size peg    Student enjoys the game and will come with the solution to Towers of Hanoi problem,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Divide and conquer  Greedy Approach and Dynamic programming are the different algorithm design paradigms available to design algorithms to solve any problem    In divide and conquer approach  given problem can be divided into different subproblems    Each subproblem can be solved individually and results can be combined to get final result    In greedy approach a sequence of steps are followed to solve the problem to get optimized result    In dynamic programming  for a problem with n inputs  all 2 n possible combinations of input are required to be considered to get the result    Innovative teaching techniques can be used to explain different concept like Convex Hull  Knapsack problem  travelling sales person problem  Trees and N Queens Problem    A    Asymptotic Notations There may be many techniques to solve one problem    Which one to choose out of available techniques? Asymptotic notations are used to represent the complexities of different algorithms    Concept of Asymptotic notations can be explained with the help of analogy  so that it could be understood better    Consider three persons taking part in a race    Person A is with his bicycle  Person B is with Car and Person C is with Airplane     Big Oh  O  notation Compare Person B with Person C    When race starts  Person B with car may need some time to start his car  operate gears and other things  Person C with airplane may take some more time for initial take off  meanwhile Person B might have started travelling    So  for some distance  say n0  Person C may be behind Person B  but after some time Person C will travel so fast that  Person B can t catch him    In this case  Person C represents Big “oh”  O  which is nothing but the upper bound    Person B is normal user  procedure   he can t overtake person C    So Big “oh”  O  represents upper bound beyond which we can t go    While representing complexity  Big “oh”  O  is worst case    While solving any problem the time needed is always less than this value represented by Big “oh”  O      Omega  ?  notation Compare Person A with Person B    When race starts  Person B with car may need some time to start his car  operate gears and other things  Meanwhile Person A with bicycle  might have started travelling    So  for some distance  say n0  Person B may be behind Person A  but after some time Person B will travel so fast that  Person A can t catch him    In this case  Person A represents Omega  ?   which is nothing but the lower bound    Person B is normal user  procedure   he can t be overtaken by person A    So Omega  ?  represents lower bound below which we will never go    While representing complexity  Omega  ?  is best case    Any problem can t be solved in less time  than this value represented by Omega  ?      Theta  ?     notation Compare all three  Person A  Person B and Person C    Person B with car may need some time to start his car  operate gears and other things  Person C with airplane may take some more time for initial take off  Meanwhile Person A with bicycle  might have started travelling    So  for some distance  say n0  Person B and Person C may be behind Person A  but after some time Person B will travel in such a way that  he can t overtake Person C and Person A can t catch him    In this case  Person A represents Omega  ?   which is nothing but the lower bound    Person B is normal user  procedure   he can t be overtaken by person A    Person C represents Big “oh”  O  which is nothing but the upper bound    Person B can t overtake person C    So Theta  ?  represents both  lower bound below which we will never go and upper bound beyond which we can t go    While representing complexity  Omega  ?  is best case  Big “oh”  O  is worst case and Theta  ?  represents both    B    Convex Hull Convex Hull problem is to find convex polygon  which encompasses all the points given    Graham s scan technique to find Convex Hull can be demonstrated by using role play    Some students represent the nodes    One of the student traverses through these nodes    Change of directions by this student will be noted    If he takes right move  then that node from where he has taken right move will be discarded    These steps can be carried out to find final convex polygon    C    Knapsack Problem Knapsack problem can be demonstrated by a game    Some items can be kept at different positions    Each item will have its own cost and weight    Give a bag of capacity 10 kilograms and 100 Rupees to one student and ask him to buy the different items so that maximum items should be purchased in 100 rupees and sum of their weights should be less than or equal to bag capacity 10 kilograms    D    N Queens Problem N Queens Problem is to place N nonattacking queens on a chess board of size N X N    N Queens Problem can be explained with the help of multimedia game    Ask user to keep 4 queens on 4 X 4 chessboard so that no queen attacks another queen    E    Travelling Salesperson Problem Travelling Salesperson Problem is to a find minimum cost tour for a salesperson  in which he visits all the cities mentioned    Travelling Salesperson Problem can be also explained by playing activity    Some students represent different places    Assign distance between all pairs    Ask one student to visit all these places by keeping total distance minimum,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1 — Familiarize students with UX and UI design principlesMolding design work around the user  their behavior and their goals is key to successful user experience    But how do you go about instilling this mindset in a nonUXer? Budding UX designers need a basic understanding of what user experience design entails and the importance of having users involved throughout the UX design process   Start by providing a primer on UX — defining the most important terms  such as user experience  usercentered design and usability    Before practicing UX design  students — particularly those without a design background — will need to be schooled in some UI design principles and the psychological aspects of design    These include    color  balance  contrast  typography  consistency  texture  shape and form  value and space    And with users demanding equal parts of beauty  ease and accessibility in their products  UX designer students must learn how to combine visual design with usability principles   2 — Teach students how to relate design to emotionWith UX design students coming from diverse professional backgrounds  they may seem like total novices    But that s not necessarily the case    Many will come equipped with preexisting skills that can be leveraged to strengthen their UX skill set    Remember  there is no prescribed path to UX design   Product managers  marketers and business analysts all have skills that can be transferred to the world of UX  such as project planning  market research and documenting and managing requirements   These hard skills will help budding UXers approaching the field    But let s not forget about the soft skills that also make a difference — such as empathy    Empathy  the ability to understand and share someone s feelings  helps UXers pick up on user needs and motivations and introduce that information into their work    Take YouTube for example    Looking to target the next billion internet users  UX researches from India investigated why data was costly and slow    These studies resulted in the birth of YouTube s offline mode feature that works with low or no connectivity   With new UX recruits  you need to dispel the tunnel vision related to beautiful  but very unusable designs    Think    ‘how can I make this simpler?  Good design is all about clarity  removing or combining elements to make the information more concise and easier for the user to digest   Get students to evaluate a user interface and have them sketch out how they might adjust the content so it is more useful to the user    Then  get them to create a highfidelity screen mockup to build out improvements to the navigation flow   3 — Teach beyond the curriculum with examplebased learningWhen it comes to molding the UX designer mindset  you need to apply design thinking to real problems   Examplebased learning is a valuable approach to teaching UX    Providing students with examples or case studies helps them internalize what they have learned — and important skill for UX designers who need to put themselves in their users  shoes in order to create effective solutions   “You wouldn t teach someone to be a carpenter by only teaching them about what a saw is — you want them to use that saw to create a table   ”  Examplebased learning usually involves students receiving instructional explanations of new concepts followed by examples thereof    It s a fail forward technique used by entrepreneurs  such as those looking to share in the Uber limelight including ‘Uber for Laundry  and ‘Uber for Kids     Designers tend to be visual thinkers  so don t just talk UX war stories    Get some discussion going around realworld problems    Split students into pairs and perform user interviews  alternating between interviewer and interviewee    Then  decide who these problems might affect using user personas and map out potential solutions using user journeys    Use a user persona template to get started   4 — Create a culture of collaborationIn an era of crossfunctional teamwork and agile software methodology  new UX designers will be stepping into collaborative design environments    Working in product teams with developers  product managers and project stakeholders will require a particular set of skills    communication  reliability  conflict management etc    Teaching designers how to ace teamwork is important    Here s a great group workshop technique    Split students into groups and get them to create a mind map or product roadmap together    If the class is inhouse  give students pens and paper to start sketching out their ideas together    Get them to divide tasks up between each other and allow them to manage the project between each other    Someone will need to be in charge of requirements  someone else each product team s tasks and so on   If yours is a distancelearning course  consider getting students set up with a collaborative design tool    They will be able to work on their roadmap prototype simultaneously from a distance  ideating together and capturing each other s feedback    They can then iterate the prototypes  folding in their feedback and findings   In your last session with your students  conduct a mock project retrospective with them    This involves sitting together and reviewing what went well and what could be improved for next time    Successful design teams perform retrospectives and/or performance reviews at the end of each project or Agile sprint to assess progress  strengths and weaknesses,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
The projects are performed on group basis    The entire project consists of several phases    The first one is to find all the resources to form IP private networks which are usually situated in students  homes    The network is set up in a month s time    Therefore  the students had to read ahead and understand some of the basic networking concepts  such as IP subnets and NAT    The first phase is concluded with a presentation on the network setup    The second phase is to observe how network protocols work by conducting experiments on the personal computer network    At the end of the project  each group is asked to submit a written report and make a final presentation    2   1 Configuring private IP networks A minimum set up includes two subnets—an Ethernet LAN and a PPP network    A Linux system is configured as a router that also performs Network Address Translation  NAT     Although the test network is small  it contains both pointtopoint and broadcast networks    Moreover  the PPP s MTU can be manually configured to cater for experiments on IP fragmentation and TCP throughput    Advanced students are able to configure more complex networks and services    2    Starting from last year I have asked students to configure an IPSec tunnel between two such private networks    Therefore  two or more project groups need to work among them to set up such tunnels    Through the process of setting up the network  students pick up various invaluable practical skills of configuring networks  diagnosing network problems  and finding solutions to them    These skills cannot be taught adequately in traditional laboratory sessions    In particular  the students will be familiarized with the followings after this stage of project    1    IP addressing scheme 2    The concept of IP subnets and subnet masks 3    Default router configurations 4    PPP network setup 5    NAT setup using iptables 6    Network diagnosis tools  such as ipconfig  ping  and netstat 7    Setting up various network services  such as SSH  HTTP  TELNET  SAMBA   2   2 Network experimentation The second part is to reinforce the principles learned in lectures by performing various experiments on the network    In other words  the handson experiments draw students closer to the Computer Networking principles  because they can now visualize how protocols work for themselves    There are several types of experiments    The first one is simply to observe how network protocols work  e   g     they can observe 1    How ARP resolves the target MAC addresses using datalink broadcast  KEITHNOTEBOOK  Windows XP  eth0    172   16   0   15 ED_NOTEBOOK  Windows XP  eth0    172   16   0   16 Paul  Redhat Linux 8  1742L  Redhat Linux 8  0516L  Redhat Linux 9  eth0    172   16   128   15 kenhall  Windows XP  eth0    192   168   0   15 Subnet 1 100BaseT Ethernet Star Topology using Hubs Network/Subnet ID    172   16   0   0/17 Subnet 2 100BaseT Ethernet Star Topology using Ethernet Switch Network/Subnet ID    172   16   128   0/17 Subnet 3 100BaseT Ethernet Network/Subnet ID    192   128   0   0/24 100Mbps Fast Ethernet switch eth1    192   168   0   1 eth0    172   16   0   1 eth1    172   16   128   2 turtle  Windows ME  eth0    172   16   0   17 Internet eth2    172   16   128   1 Network/Subnet ID    158   132   45   0/24 Gateway    158   132   45   2 Subnet 4 11Mbps Wireless  Adhoc  Ethernet Network/Subnet ID    192   168   1   0/24 SSID    PAUL WEP    01   3b   4d   2b   3e   6a   7c   45   12   1d   2d   14   5e  104bits  KEITHNOTEBOOK  Windows XP  wlan0    192   168   1   2 wlan0    192   168   1   1 ED_NOTEBOOK  Windows XP  wlan0    192   168   1   3 eth0    172   16   128   1 100Mbps Fast Ethernet switch    2    How the NAT router translates the internal IP addresses and ports  3    How a router fragments an IP packet  4    The TCP threeway handshaking messages and the protocol values  and 5    The TCP s persistent behavior in setting up a connection    Another set of experiments is related to the measurement of the network performance    For example  based on the measurement results  students can investigate 1    The effect of frame collisions on an Ethernet network s performance  2    The relationship between MTU and network throughput  3    The effect of IP fragmentation on the network throughput  4    The effect of packet fragmentation on the network performance  5    The relationship between buffer sizes and TCP throughput  and 6    The DNS delay in repeated queries    The last set of experiments concerns network faults and misconfigurations    For example  students will observe that 1    The states of a TCP connection are not affected by a nonpersistent network outage  2    The protocol interactions as a result of configuring duplicate addresses on the same subnet  and 3    The effect of various hacking activities on the networks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
